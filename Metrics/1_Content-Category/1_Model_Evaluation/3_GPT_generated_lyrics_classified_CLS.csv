0,Folk,"I know how it feels to be head over heels
To be lost in true love and the light of the moon
When everything seems to be coming up roses
And every word seems to be rhyming with June
Suddenly, all of your dreams have come true
Happiness lives in your heart
Then out of nowhere, one becomes two
And everything seems to be falling apart
Is it love? When your heart, feels like it's broken
Is it love? And you just can't take anymore
Is it love? When there's nothing left to be spoken
Is it love? And there's nothing worth listening for
Is it love? ooh ooh
I know what it means to get caught up in dreams
And in prayers that are answered with each passing day
When loving and laughter are birds of a feather
And sharing and caring is one simple way
You know you'll never be alone
That someone will always be near
Then you turn around when your best friend is gone
Oh, where do they go? When they just disappear?
Is it love? When your heart, feels like it's broken
Is it love? And you just can't take anymore
Is it love? When the good times have all been forgotten
Is it love? And you fear there won't be anymore
Is it love? ooh ooh
There's no answer, there seems to be nothing to say
In your anger would you even hear anyway
It was magic but somehow you've broken the spell
It was heaven and somehow it's turned into hell

Is it love? And you just can't take it anymore

6,Folk,"The old folks don't talk much
They talk so slowly when they do
They are rich they are poor
Their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two
Their homes all smell of time
Of old photographs
And an old fashioned song
Though you may live in town
You live so far away
When you've lived too long
Have they laughed too much
Do their dry voices crack
Talking of things gone by
Have they cried too much
A tear or two still always seems
To cloud the eye
They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock oh so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you
The old folks dream no more
Their books have gone to sleep
The piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead
And no more do they sing on a sunday afternoon
The old folks move no more
Their world become to small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out a window
Or else sit it a chair
Or else they stay in bed
And if they still go out
Arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning chill
Its to have a good cry
To say their last goodbye
To one who's older still
And then they go home
To the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock so so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you
The old folks never die
They just put down their heads
And go to sleep one day
They will hold each others hands
Like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway
And the other will remain
Just sitting in a room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now
The song has died away
And echo's all around
You'll see them as they walk
Through the sun filled parks
Where children run and play
It hurst to much to smile
It hurts so much
But life goes on for still another day
As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock oh so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you

8,Folk,"When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chittlins'
When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street!
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely!
Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on!
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down
We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says ""Pork Pie Hat Bar""
And there's black babies dancing...

You must feel such gratitude

There's no one left to call my bluff
A lot of my old friends have passed on
The rest did drugs and their memory's gone
So I'll write my own history
In my autobiography
I'll say I slept with a Kennedy
Don't remember which one
They all looked the same to me
Or they did when we got done
Maybe they'll film it for TV
I wonder who they'll cast as me
Should be somebody I look like
Sigourney Weaver'd be all right
Gonna be hard to deal with fame
Once the whole world knows my name
But I'll stay humble and grateful to

And I sat before his sanity
I was holding back from crying
He saw my complications
And he mirrored me back simplified
And we laughed how our perfection
Would always be denied
""Heart and humor and humility""
He said ""Will lighten up your heavy load""
I left him for the refuge of the roads

I fell in with some drifters
Cast upon a beachtown
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And I wound up fixing dinner
For them and Boston Jim
I well up with affection
Thinking back down the roads to then
The nets were overflowing
In the Gulf of Mexico
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads

There was spring along the ditches
There were good times in the cities
Oh radiant happiness
It was all so light and easy
Till I started analyzing
And I brought on my old ways
A thunderhead of judgment was
Gathering in my gaze
And it made most people nervous
They just didn't want to know
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads

I pulled off into a forest
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Like a wheel of fortune
I heard my fate turn turn turn
And I went running down a white sand road
I was running like a white-assed deer
Running to lose the blues
To the innocence in here
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
Muscular with gods and sungold
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads

In a highway service station
Over the month of June
Was a photograph of the earth
Taken coming back from the moon

When this old gray, black gentleman was cleaning up the lounge
There wasn't anyone around, except this old man and me

And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down.""

God bless little children while they're still to young to hate.""

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

When the sun comes shining as I was strolling
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there
And that sign said ""No trespassin'""
But on the other side .... it didn't say nothin!
Now that side was made for you and me!

This land is your land, and this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple
Near the relief office - I see my people
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'
If this land's still made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters

Take a walk just a little ways
And as we walked, along we talk
All would be our wedding day
And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say
And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity""
I took her by her golden curls
And drug her down to the river side
And there I threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down
And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
And going home between twelve and one
I cried ""Oh Lord, what have I've done?""
I've killed the only girl I love
Because she would not marry me

See now, the leaves, how they die
Love needs no reason for ending

What ever love ever was, never lasted too long
Maybe the best of our life was the beautiful dreamin'
That conscience was destined to crumble like castles of sand
All there is left of our love is a little girl's laughter
Let her keep making believing as long as she can

By Carole King
The rebel cry of desolation
To which we used to hearken
Echoes now in isolation
As the skies in fury darken
A thousand acts of desecration
Hundreds more continue
When y'know that you are all creation
You're gonna fight them with all that's in you
I remember time gone by
When peace and hope and dreams were high
We followed inner visions and touched the sky
Now we who still believe won't let them die
Waters dammed to overflowing
Like tears brimming over in our eyes
Sometimes it's so hard to keep on going
When promises turn to lies
Go ahead, give into confussion
And put aside your ideals too
Soon you'll see only illusion
Don't care who's hurt
As long as it's not you
CHORUS
Soemtimes a leader emerges
And is followed for a while
Doesn't matter what he encourages
Just as long as he's got style
Young ones conceived in a passion
Of directions we thought enlighted
Grown up they follow the mood in fashion
But beneathe their bravado
You know they're frightened

In the night
When the moon was in the yard
He took her hand in his and
Shook the long hair
From his neck
And he told her
She'd been working much too hard
It was true that ever since the day
Her crazy man had passed away
To the land of poet's pride
She laughed and talked a lot
With new people on the block
But always at evening time she cried

And here's to the dawn of their days

A little down on the bed
Until it rested softly on his knee
And there she dropped her smile
And there she sighed awhile
And told him all the sadness
Of those years that numbered three
""Well you know I think my fate's belated
Because of all the hours I waited
For the day when I'd no longer cry
I get myself to work by eight
But oh, was I born too late
And do you think I'll fail
At every single thing I try?""

The tear tracks upon her face

A beach blonde mama with a streak of mean

Her fans called her Tuffy, but all her buddies called her Spike

Grabbed the yellow pages under the bed
I noticed an ad, it said
'Indian summer', '10 days of wonder'
'Paradise is yours for 50'
I thought to myself that's it
Told the wife to pack the bag
Forget about the plans we had
We're going east instead
She looked at me and shakes her head
I said, ""Oh now, baby
I know it sounds crazy
But this may be the only chance we get
We only get one life to live""

And some body lotion
And we went to the middle of the
Indian Ocean
Our guide was there to meet us
'Welcome' sign to greet us
Ten porters stood up like a wall
Carried our bags to the hall
The custom man smiled to me
Begs so politely
""Tell me, sir, have you any more?""
I looked at him and said, ""That's all""
They drove us to the beach house
I said, ""Is this all ours?""
They nodded and rolled out the bed

Let's all go down for a dip
Before the sun sets""

Upon the rising wave
I saw the sea drawn from the sand
I grabbed the wife and kids and ran
""Please God, save us
Please don't blame us

Scrambled up the mountain

Searching for her mum and dad
A thin dress was all she had
She held us tight
We looked far and wide

There was nothing left

A wide scarlet sash, black boots and a whip
Or the tango is done with seafaring trash
Callous and brash, fresh off the ship
Or the tango is done as a dangerous dance
A treacherous step and if one should trip
The frail body breaks with a snap and a twist
And a gold watch slips onto a thick tattooed wrist
And a gray merchant ship turns black in the sun
As it heaves to the East when the tango is done
Butterflies mounted on fields of black velvet
Neatly arranged in gleaming glass trays
One-eyed Etruscans play follow-the-leader
Forever around the edge of the vase
The phonograph's playing an old broken record
A tango and over and over it plays
Over it plays
Over it plays
A medieval tapestry hangs like a warning
A needlepoint forest of dark green and brown
The scene is the hunt, you will notice the hunter
He takes careful aim as your eye travels down
And finally rests upon the real victim
Lying quite still in a silk dressing gown
Lying quite still at the edge of the carpet
One arm flung out for the peacocks to peck
Blending in well with the blue and green background
Except for the bright scarlet sash round the neck
He was a collector of beautiful strangers
And life was a party right up to the end
The door always opened to love and loves dangers
Though dead, a lover, a stranger, a friend

That at heart you're really not so bad

And yet
I love your funny face
Your sunny, funny face;
For you're a cutie
With more than beauty
You've got a lot
Of personality N.T
A thousand laughs I've found
In having you around
Though you're not Gloria Swanson
For worlds I'd not replace
Your sunny, funny face
Needn't tell me that I'm not so pretty, dear
When my looking glass and I agree
In the contest at Atlantic City, dear
Miss America I'd never be

As a Paul Swan, you are not so hot yourself
And yet

You can't repair it

I love your funny face

You never bother
About your father
Have you no shame?
You're just a mutt and nothing but!

If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
To throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
With people saying
""My God that's tough, she stood him up""
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Oh, if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? what do we do?

Looking back over the years
What ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide my tears

And at sixty five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day (cried, and cried all day)

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man
But he done her wrong!
One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!
Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!
Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!""
Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!""
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!
So they put her away in a dungeon
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!
But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried

9,Metal,"It is sad to think that the first few people on earth needed no books, movies, games or music to inspire cold-blooded murder. The day that Cain bashed his brother Abel's brains in, the only motivation he needed was his own human disposition to violence. Whether you interpret the Bible as literature or as the final word of whatever God may be, Christianity has given us an image of death and sexuality that we have based our culture around. A half-naked dead man hangs in most homes and around our necks, and we have just taken that for granted all our lives. Is it a symbol of hope or hopelessness? The world's most famous murder-suicide was also the birth of the death icon ‚Äì the blueprint for celebrity. Unfortunately, for all of their inspiring morality, nowhere in the Gospels is intelligence praised as a virtue
A lot of people forget or never realize that I started my band as a criticism of these very issues of despair and hypocrisy. The name Marilyn Manson has never celebrated the sad fact that America puts killers on the cover of Time magazine, giving them as much notoriety as our favorite movie stars. From Jesse James to Charles Manson, the media, since their inception, have turned criminals into folk heroes. They just created two new ones when they plastered those dip-shits Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris' pictures on the front of every newspaper. Don't be surprised if every kid who gets pushed around has two new idols
We applaud the creation of a bomb whose sole purpose is to destroy all of mankind, and we grow up watching our president's brains splattered all over Texas. Times have not become more violent. They have just become more televised. Does anyone think the Civil War was the least bit civil? If television had existed, you could be sure they would have been there to cover it, or maybe even participate in it, like their violent car chase of Princess Di. Disgusting vultures looking for corpses, exploiting, fucking, filming and serving it up for our hungry appetites in a gluttonous display of endless human stupidity
When it comes down to who's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you'll hit someone who's guilty. We're the people who sit back and tolerate children owning guns, and we're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them. I think it's terrible when anyone dies, especially if it is someone you know and love. But what is more offensive is that when these tragedies happen, most people don't really care any more than they Would about the season finale of Friends or The Real World. I was dumbfounded as I watched the media snake right in, not missing a teardrop, interviewing the parents of dead children, televising the funerals. Then came the witch hunt
Man's greatest fear is chaos. It was unthinkable that these kids did not have a simple black-and-white reason for their actions. And so a scapegoat was needed. I remember hearing the initial reports from Littleton, that Harris and Klebold were wearing makeup and were dressed like Marilyn Manson, whom they obviously must worship, since they were dressed in black. Of course, speculation snowballed into making me the poster boy for everything that is bad in the world. These two idiots weren't wearing makeup, and they weren't dressed like me or like goths. Since Middle America has not heard of the music they did listen to (KMFDM and Rammstein, among others), the media picked something they thought was similar
Responsible journalists have reported with less publicity that Harris and Klebold were not Marilyn Manson fans ‚Äì that they even disliked my music. Even if they were fans, that gives them no excuse, nor does it mean that music is to blame. Did we look for James Huberty's inspiration when he gunned down people at McDonald's? What did Timothy McVeigh like to watch? What about David Koresh, Jim Jones? Do you think entertainment inspired Kip Kinkel, or should we blame the fact that his father bought him the guns he used in the Springfield, Oregon, murders? What inspires Bill Clinton to blow people up in Kosovo? Was it something that Monica Lewinsky said to him? Isn't killing just killing, regardless if it's in Vietnam or Jonesboro, Arkansas? Why do we justify one, just because it seems to be for the right reasons? Should there ever be a right reason? If a kid is old enough to drive a car or buy a gun, isn't he old enough to be held personally responsible for what he does with his car or gun? Or if he's a teenager, should someone else be blamed because he isn't as enlightened as an eighteen-year-old?
America loves to find an icon to hang its guilt on. But, admittedly, I have assumed the role of Antichrist; I am the Nineties voice of individuality, and people tend to associate anyone who looks and behaves differently with illegal or immoral activity. Deep down, most adults hate people who go against the grain. It's comical that people are naive enough to have forgotten Elvis, Jim Morrison and Ozzy so quickly. All of them were subjected to the same age-old arguments, scrutiny and prejudice. I wrote a song called ""Lunchbox,"" and some journalists have interpreted it as a song about guns. Ironically, the song is about being picked on and fighting back with my Kiss lunch box, which I used as a weapon on the playground. In 1979, metal lunch boxes were banned because they were considered dangerous weapons in the hands of delinquents. I also wrote a song called ""Get Your Gunn."" The title is spelled with two n's because the song was a reaction to the murder of Dr. David Gunn, who was killed in Florida by pro-life activists while I was living there. That was the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being ""prolife."" The somewhat positive messages of these songs are usually the ones that sensationalists misinterpret as promoting the very things I am decrying
Right now, everyone is thinking of how they can prevent things like Littleton. How do you prevent AIDS, world war, depression, car crashes? We live in a free country, but with that freedom there is a burden of personal responsibility. Rather than teaching a child what is moral and immoral, right and wrong, we first and foremost can establish what the laws that govern us are. You can always escape hell by not believing in it, but you cannot escape death and you cannot escape prison
It is no wonder that kids are growing up more cynical; they have a lot of information in front of them. They can see that they are living in a world that's made of bullshit. In the past, there was always the idea that you could turn and run and start something better. But now America has become one big mall, and because of the Internet and all of the technology we have, there's nowhere to run. People are the same everywhere. Sometimes music, movies and books are the only things that let us feel like someone else feels like we do. I've always tried to let people know it's OK, or better, if you don't fit into the program. Use your imagination ‚Äì if some geck from Ohio can become something, why can't anyone else with the willpower and creativity?
I chose not to jump into the media frenzy and defend myself, though I was begged to be on every single TV show in existence. I didn't want to contribute to these fameseeking journalists and opportunists looking to fill their churches or to get elected because of their self-righteous finger-pointing. They want to blame entertainment? Isn't religion the first real entertainment? People dress up in costumes, sing songs and dedicate themselves in eternal fandom. Everyone will agree that nothing was more entertaining than Clinton shooting off his prick and then his bombs in true political form. And the news ‚Äì that's obvious. So is entertainment to blame? I'd like media commentators to ask themselves, because their coverage of the event was some of the most gruesome entertainment any of us have seen. I think that the National Rifle Association is far too powerful to take on, so most people choose Doom, The Basketball Diaries or yours truly. This kind of controversy does not help me sell records or tickets, and I wouldn't want it to. I'm a controversial artist, one who dares to have an opinion and bothers to create music and videos that challenge people's ideas in a world that is watered-down and hollow. In my work I examine the America we live in, and I've always tried to show people that the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us. So don't expect the end of the world to come one day out of the blue ‚Äì it's been happening every day for a long time","it is sad to think that the first few people on earth needed no books movies or tv i just loved the experience and i'm very glad i did the next chapter was all about living my life but it is also about my loved ones and the history of earth and i'm proud of it!

Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you about his years


Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale


Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go


Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale


Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again

We're doomed to face the night

Just a voice from the otherworld
Like a leaf in an icy world

Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
May my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile

We'll face the storm created by man
Troy, Troy, Troy, Troy
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb
Hallowed Troy shall fall
Round the wall
Faith is shattered, bodies fall
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose, like one we'll stand
It's all for one and one for all
All we live for will be wiped out
I feel that something's wrong
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon, your time goes by
A new moon's still kept out of sight
(We live)
Misty tales and poems lost
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
May my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end
Iliad
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell, show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
Roam in darkness
Spread the vision
We will be lost if you truly believe
Troy in darkness
There's a cold emptiness in our hearts
That they've gone away
And won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite
The end is near
You'd better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
The war, it is over, forevermore
No hope, the blind leads the blind
Carry on, though future's denied
Mare or stallion, there's far more inside
We're in at the kill
We'll cheerfully die
Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
May my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end
Iliad
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell, show me the way

The crack of doom

Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide

Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?

It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!

Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the

There she stands with her eyes full and yearning
I look
And I know gotta be there
Is there another chance
To bring her closer
Make her feel I know we could be happy again
Is there another chance
To bring her flowers
So she will only whisper my name
A chance to make things right for her
And make my lies seem true
I'm begging Do
Don't go down to the station
Somehow we won't live that long
Don't go now, desert flower
Cause you just won't bloom
And your memories made need more room
See that mirror there
Will she look inside
To see the one I fear standing alone
And on my phonograph
Will she put them in
The songs that only remind her of me
A chance to make things right for her
And make my life seem true
I'm begging Do

I step outside The Joint
To clouds of guilt and fear
And there are shades of red dancing in view

It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um‚Ä¶

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)

Imagine the Backstreet Boys
Here with the Neptunes
Call it the rec room
Play time now holla
Pusha be the one you follow
Slo' mow, low-low
Thousand spoke on the go to Impala
Crushin', love my women in couples
One each arm, keep double the trouble
So I gotta, shift 'em and shuffle
Love how I twist 'em and tussle
Sex play, next day, call me, uh

Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
I said ""Hi...
I got a little place nearby, wanna go?""
I should have said ""No!""
Someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go
(Woman)
Hello?

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go
Pharrell, (Backstreet Boys), :
Dance (Listen, baby, I'm sorry) 
Dance (Listen, baby, I'm sorry) 

Don't stay up and wait
Cause I'mma be somewhere late
I feel for ya if you can't relate
I take it aways like two days stays
But look, still hit me on my Two-way page
See, I'm heavy in the streets like a cream Denali
Cold outside? We take trips to Maui
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick and Howie
Company by Clipse, Pusha T and Mali

Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by a fried chicken ass

Where do I belong forever?

Washing my hair in the shower
It always takes five hours to make it straight

Lay under the Milky Way

Baby, I swear it's D√©j√† Vu

Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'

Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No D√©j√† Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having D√©j√† Vu?

How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in

Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room

And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts

In our haste, our need, our thirst

They're bad for me
Reluctantly you hit me
To my vulnerability
I don't like this feeling
'Cause I can't see straight
Something says I met my match
Courtesy of fate
I've always taken pride
In my independence
So afraid and careful
Not to show it
No - but you give me clarity
Like a bright green laser beam

In spite of my resistance
Be my eyes
Sing me, I'm your song

It's none of their business

It's like i live in a bubble with no trouble

Not in mind but size and age my papa use to say
You can always look at the negative
But you should always live in the positive
So i try everyday to live that way

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Some people live in what was and what they could have been
As opposed to living in a what is and how much they can
And be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way
The attitude is ""that i can't do nothing 'bout""
And very happy with just breathing in and out
The ones that when you say ""lets go make a difference""
They'll say ""naw that's ok""

Who use to always say when she was living
""Like fine wine i like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty""
I'm not saying sometimes life can't be rough
But never to the point of me saying i've had enough
Long as my heart beats i ain't giving up
That's why i say everyday


When people ask me as an african american
What do i see for tomorrow in the human plan?
Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?
I say unity is only as big as our vision
And if its narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon
But true leaders must guide us through the ills of society
That stands in our way
So if the road is to harmony, be with the call
But if its about discord, don't take the ride at all
Because the world vision i see is the one-we for everybody

We didn't make forever
We've each got to go our seperate way
And now we're standing here, helpless
Looking for something to say
We've been together a long time
We never thought it would end
We were always so close to each other;
You were always my friend
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love
Hard to see you cry, my love
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
We didn't want this to happen
But we shouldn't feel sad
We had a good life together
Just remember, remember, all the times we had
You know I'll always love you
You know I'll always care
And no matter I'll far I may go
In my heart you'll always be there
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love (It's so hard)

Against the door he leans and starts a scene

Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built up a dream that when he grew up
He would be a mighty warrior Indian chief
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until
Tomorrow he would sing his first war song and fight his first battle
But something went wrong, a surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night, damn

She couldn't speak a sound

And to her legs she smiled ""you won't hurt me no more""

4,Rap,"Tony dead and his brother too
Streets talkin' every week the coppers comin' through
And homicides scoopin' niggas out of Paulie crew
Damn, he in some shit just like a number two
So he need that lawyer money, plus that Sig Sauer money
On his second body so you don't want to war with money
Paulie got the word that somebody turned informant on him
Remember when he banged on Tony brother spin the corner on him
Maybe its them young niggas, talkin' to the police
Thinking about it every night, ain't been gettin' no sleep
He been spinnin' 'round that same corner for the whole week
Lookin' for them muthafuckers that was there with Tony brother when he let the clip roll on 'em
Going crazy thinkin' 'bout who told on him
Time tickin' doors 'bout to close on him
Them boys on the way to see the judge for a warrant
And they got his name on it, tryna put them chains on him
Cold as them streets is, he tryna remain on it
Even though the cops lurkin', got to keep them things on 'em
Layin' low at Kee crib, only one ain't changed on him
And she givin' info, told where to hit for
Put 'em deep with Tony lil' cousins and his kin folk
Paulie on some other shit, tryna get 'em sent for
Them young nigga bendin' backwards for him like its limbo
And they tryna kill somethin', cops tryna build somethin'
Paulie ain't tryna do no time take a deal, nothin'
Loadin' up his AK banana tryna peel somethin'
Tryna catch a rat nigga slippin' 'fore they spill somethin'
Somebody gon' die
And mommas gon' cry
Before Paulie doin' time
Cause Paulie gon' ride
Back in the field he got his 40 on him
Watchin' out for tinted windows when they pull up on him
He don't even trust the niggas 'round the corner from him
That he grew up with, he done got into it with
Investigatin' niggas if they tellin' or not
And then they feel some type of way he disrespectin' the block
But Paulie don't give a fuck, you disrespect him, you shot
Live by the chopper law and respect of the Glock
Hold up the phone ringin' said they rushin' the spot
The only time he play that crib is when he fuckin' a thot
He was fuckin' with Kee and she was fuckin' an op
But he ain't never think about it, she'll fuck with the cops
She told 'em everything nigga
I know you thought that she'll never sing would you?
Rule number one: keep them bitches from out your business
Rule number two: better kill 'em you know they snitchin'
It's all fun and games 'til them bitches turn to a witness
And know you in the courtroom waiting to get your sentence
Saw you out at Kee crib four in the morn'
Parked up seat low to the floor
She on the way he feel a way, this was one of his whores
And since he been on the run, he been fuckin' em more
Thinkin' about her if she come, open the door
Take a deep breath, I know what I'm doin'
Cause she gon' go to court and she gon' go to the morgue
And he gon' to jail and she gon' go to the mall
So he started walkin' while she parking
Wasn't even cautious
Parked up on her, had to drive her window out the darkness
He was supposed to shoot her, but he started talkin'
She screamin' out ""I'm pregnant,"" now he thinkin' ""Aw shit""
Started second guessin', that's when them cars spin
Paulie heart dropped he seen the Taurus
So he took off runnin' with the hammer, tried to toss it
Cops shootin' metal slugs rippin' through the car tint
Bullets hit his body while he runnin' and now he fallin'
Damn Paulie, bullet holes
Cuffs on let him bleed
Double murder, attempted murder, yes indeed
If he live, life sentence never leave
If he dies nobody cry for the bad guy
Fronted niggas workin' they the glad guys
Happy they ain't got to pay the tab guys
Paulie make it through to see the trap God
Drownin' in his blood on his back side
They say he gon' pull through and he gettin' charged too
Lawyer came to see him said he need like 80 large too
Got him in the County Tony people 'hind them walls too
And they say his little cousin crippin' bangin' hard too
And Paulie killed his favorite little cousin back on Part 2
And he can't wait to fall through
Friday they callin' yard too
And Paulie on crutches took the screw up out the handles scrape that bitch 'til it got sharp too
To be continued
I, know, you, want me to fall
But, I can't

Stuck servin' my cocaine raw
Drop sixty-two off the brick, jump back
Twenty over, now that's mo' money to get
Slick, we fin' to lick on this corner without gettin' caught
But time, keep a sleepin' and money gettin' short

Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out

Now you ridin' 'bout fo' deep, startin' to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it
But legislation got this new policy: three strikes and you're ruined
Now where your crew at? Yeah

But still ain't did nothin' that ain't been done befo'
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got

You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth

I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill

Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage

Cause there‚Äôs too much too hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate

I put some free bands in her account
I told her, ""Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout""
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer

I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain

Ball and if one of us fumble I go to the gutter
And get all my hustle it's back to the booth
Nigga let's bubble lets get in a shuffle, let's get in a scuffle
I say that we rumble and rustle up niggas we doing a cypher
Dear Lord, let a nigga be humble
Y'all still don't understand, y'all rappin' fast
Stealin' my brand that's a whole new plan, man I'm just sayin'
You siphon nigga Iraqi style, duck a nigga like Pacquiao
Broke rappers get mad so fuck you niggas, with a cash smile
I'm asphalt, salient salts solvents and vaults
Crispy weed, jars full of joints, bars, niggas lost
Faded the 'Bron Cleveland play, Miami like Weezy stay
Get me the fuck up outta here
Cock the pump, slap the clip into the Glock and spit it fast so that I can get it, go with it
For the block, meet the coppers on the corner where they sell rocks
So fitted tight like a glove acquitted, I'm OJ Simpson
I'm Michael Jackson, I'm Lupe Fiasco
These muthafuckas don't understand me I'm flippin'
Threateningly leave the kitchen
Cooking these scriptures in liquids
Saut√©e that lettering in skillets of harmony
Spices, no cinnamon with one more element some rhythm and
Ritalin rippin' 'em, no vitamins, Biblical flowing like Gideon's
Clack back me pump, hollow point mixed wit dum-dum kickin'
Rappers that laying all over the floor, shut up and listen
It's a jack move, stalking gat fools, I got some bad news
We finna get at you
Kickin'...that's when we pass through
Tried to leave us out the cypher, let them thugs have a glass with you
Mash with you, five niggas rappin' with a passion, fast with you
Rocks that makes me flash with you, smash with you and at you too
Bone don't move 'til I ask you to
See my goons will smash half of this room if I ask them to
Before I leave, better ask my dudes:
Ain't we the coldest group ever?
Word to Eazy, nigga with attitudes
Cleveland city avenues
Crack house is the death of our mentalists
Momma lended a track and Wally my niggas
Shit grin, make me grin again, me and my niggas gettin' it in
Y'all finna be coasting to that same Bone shit again

Nervous for a second, then the rest...
(Krayzie Bone!)
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum

I come with a militant vision for all them niggas, that's ready for lyrical war
Finna do way more than just even the score
The thugs we come for blood, so guard your grill
We are the deal, we all real, y'all already know who that
They never seen a rapper like me that's relevant yet I'm considered a throwback
Call it classic swag it's Kray Action Jack
I pick up the mic and they all say ""damn, bad man do that""
The game done studied me long time now, but it still can't seem to really get it
Niggas wicked, just admit it
My niggas the sickest with it
I pick up the pen and I go in like a surgeon
Verbally come to save a dying game 'cause it's hurtin'
I tell 'em to follow the leader
We keeping 'em stumbling, they better speed up
Y'all niggas can't tell me how this game don't need us, we up!
And get ball, first and ten, needing a touchdown once again
The game is over, niggas, once I'm in
I'm sneakin' up on 'em like I was the wind and blow 'em away
And shoo 'em the way
The fuck up outta here, the storm is coming today
And it's in the form of Kray
I tell 'em you should've been checked the forecast
I'm so bad, with the pen and the notepad I get up in your ass
So how in the hell is they doing the cypher
But never invited the illest spitters, realest niggas
Known to kick a little ass and after that, handle some business (Hey)
I figure they scared of the Thugs just cause we too real
Still runnin' with gats and bats and hoes you finna get hit with true steel
We one in a mill, we coming to kill 'em all
Less drama more music, so don't choose it
'Cause I got a pump and if it jump off I'm gon' use it
It's mister goddamn murderer, lyrically kill 'em permanent
And after I battle wit'chu, y'all gon' wanna forfeit the tournament
Competitors no concern in here
Heartbeat but it never did pump no fear
So thinkin' you finna come up in this bitch and just lean on me, that ain't fair
Sick of these lil' niggas running around like Bone ain't they daddy
Illegitimate bastard, some of them resemble me a little
But none of them get it like pappy
And tell your mammy I ain't payin' her nothing, so don't even ask me
Real nigga, I still keep my heat and crease my khakis
I'm finna get ill nigga take out your weapon 'cause nigga the beat done got me
They doubt me, but ask yourself just where would you be without me?
Been here 20 years, many years they still ain't ready for me
I'm constant run like the river nigga, I'm steady flowing
They tell me they love me, the way that I flip it or spit the harmony with it
Created the lane and step on this gas, so nigga don't bother me with it
They know that title belong to Bone
So nigga just leave it alone, and let us move on
I'm here with that Leather, my brotha, my niggas are sick with it
Real as it get with it
We on the mission to pick up the pieces and stick with it
Flow like I'm liquid, so slick with it
Roll with them niggas that used to be criminals
Now we just get in 'em lyrical
Niggas been acting like me and my niggas ain't good wit 'em now that the game went digital
Shame them niggas don't really know that we started it, fathered it, birthed it
We be the heart of it
So give me the beat, the melody really don't matter 'cause I'm killing all of it
I hit em up in they mind like a 9  'cause its
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum redrum

Let the lil' man get a piece, fuck everybody
I slap niggas first anyway, nigga
(Layzie Bone!)

Who want it with Layzie, nigga, fuck you, pay me
Been doing is since the '80s, early '80s
Nobody can fade me, my partner in rhyme is still Krayzie
And we finna break bread
The rest of them niggas got laid down and play dead
With Bizzy and Wish and Flesh, I roll on them niggas
I never did play fair
We represent St. Clair
The struggle the grind, the grit and the muscle
The First of the Month, Foe tha Love of the Money
That Grammy the shit, that's how I hustle
Trust me, nope, them niggas don't want no trouble
Niggas be skeletons in my boneyard, trying to show hard
Nigga, I'll buck you, buck you
I cut like a Ginsu
Them niggas is going through what I done been through
I get in the cypher, I set niggas diapers on fire to show 'em what men do
They hut and attend to the order the generals call in the field
My 110 too, you're 50 percent and you claiming that real
Lay, that's why I'm hard to fade, Hall of Fame
Put me up in the Hall of Fame
Layzie Bone givin' you all the game
Y'all explain what's understood and never did have to be
Savagely I ravage beats, my money attracted magically
But I had the key, could've picked the lock, instead I chose to kick the door
Tragically it had to be for the ones that went form friend to foe
My thugs is indispensable, friendship is the principle
Boys to men to the end of the road, but Tha Crossroads not the pinnacle
It's a winner though, all original, it's history now I'mma make it stick
My nigga we 'bout to be Laker rich
That mystery murder man break a snitch
Taking trips, yep we party on plenty of acreage
The Bone be going for twenty years strong
Now how in the fuck can we fake this shit?
Bitch, yep I ride with 2 Glocks
Stick a rapper up for his new chain, hit 'em up like I'm 2Pac
Wanna do things? I move crowds cause that bang bang get too loud
Forever they callin' me young thug 'cause the unplugged is the new style now
Who in the fuck is claiming the best in the business
And where's the arena that niggas is playing in?
'Cause I'm 'bout to get wit 'em
I'm hearing king this, throne that
All the influenced Bone rap
Get ready my nigga we at it again, them other ones taking that long nap
Never met a click of five, mighty Mo Thug we still alive
FBG, yeah it's the life, Harmony Howse, and Seventh Sign
Perfect, nigga this A to Z and we workin'
Been around the globe with Steve Lo' shouts out to Full Surface
Nigga it's your time, Go time, I'mma bust in the low mine
Dangerous like a gold mine, clickin' up like Voltron
Biatch! (laugh)
(Wish Bone!)

Y'all niggas to quit that, this is real rap, y'all niggas need to sit back
Wanna learn a little somethin' from the teacher? I got that
Lyrical holder, spit fire, or smotherer, or get swolled up
I'm a grown man, with a life long plan, understand that?
It could go ugly, murders, how old do you think I am?
But I still got hands and I put 'em on ya
For the real rap era formula, I warned ya
Get missing, hood ceremony, got some ditches you bitches
At the same time, we move a life long hustle my niggas
Say sorry from the top, gotta lie, gotta have that money
Power, respect we earned that
Maintain twenty years in the game and Bone ain't done yet
You heard me, we ain't done yet
It ain't over 'til it's over, and it ain't over
Worst nightmare, don't you play with me
Or we can be partners, nigga, get money
Lamborghini dream, empty pocket realities, that's not for me, See me
We can part on the North Side, ride
And we gon' party on the East Side, ride
And we gon' party on the South Side, ride
We gonna keep it real in the West (West) for Eazy-E
Give me my shoes and I'mma run wit 'em
My story's far from the soft nigga, and I stand wit 'em
I got what you want and what you need
Only thing that makes me old school is this .38 snub
No clues, no fools, and plus my bad bitch she got  Ooh
It's amazing these niggas still playing, still praying
And all that's lost, especially the boss
And on that note, I'm lost
Y'all niggas go ahead and do this shit, I'm done
I love you Bri Bri

About to unleash another one of those platnum plus hits
And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets
We gon go to a live remote, licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg

A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Real, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Heron rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein' jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't ""Pull My Ho Card""
.. I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin' niggas off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh I know (bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style
.. I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin'
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for ""1-8-7 on a cop""
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip!

It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (gon' get pimp slapped)

Money, I get it, paper I got it
I got the dope
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
Run up, ya get done up, I stay one up

If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worse than them devils
Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em
But I'ma say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up
Cause I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt (shshshsh)
See that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up (what's up)
He better keep it Crippin', and slip his clip in
Cause these niggas trippin', this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected misdirected, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Do Double in the hood again (Eastside)
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it (feel it)
So put the bacon in the skillet (hahaha), and try to peel it
Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga

That it was a mistake
I accept that as a part of my destiny!


Whattup kid? That's right..
Yo.. Aiyyo.. Aiyyo..

Aiyyo let my niggas live
We show and prove get paper, catch me in the caper on shrooms yo
Let my niggas live
We real niggas that's God-body, challenge anything, make major moves
Let my niggas live
We giants, live off the land lions, post with iron, no pryin rules
Let my niggas live; aiyyo let my niggas live
Handle your bid and kill no kids

Millionaire feat, whole family eat; yo, y'all niggas is weak
Got a bird beak, chirp chirp speak
Kids that's rich that'll, run in your bitch and by the third week
Yo mark my word, me and my herb speak
That's that fire move like Schwinns yo
Invisible pens that write light, leave blends
Hit with the jf Kennedy shot
Smash with the Acapulco rifle got got
Bolt off, but got clocked
Legendary here, custom made it, shit bladed, word up
Design your alphabet, reps get graded
We in get-high saloons, big bag of shrooms, arm's length
Home of Allah's ten big rooms
So what we up in here, modelin large with rigorous moves
Exotic Gods bust my hammer at frauds
Call him a live merchant, dressed in all red, that's right y'all
Gucci jumper X-5, gettin more head

I scream at the mirror, curse, askin God, ""Why me?""
Run in the black church, gun in my hand, y'all try me
I'm God-son, son of man, son of Marcus Garvey
Rastafari irie, Ha-ile Selassie
Police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
It takes more than metal bars, we destined for ours
I hear murder plans from dopefiends, with elephant hands
Snots in they nostril, the blocks is hostile
There's no pots to piss in, Glocks is spittin
Rocks cookin underground bodies stiffin, cops look at bird shit
Drop on the window pane, the oxygen is cocaine
It drove lots of men to die with no name
I been on boats, nut down throats, pee on bitches who famous
Pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
I'm the animal that Hugh Heffner created
The only nigga Sade dated, the most hated, Nas nigga

Roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
C. O. Flip and jerk the whole yard rec
Block vets, pop barettas Glocks and tecs
You're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
Checkin shorty with the +Black Tail+ stance, leapord pants
Yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a New York state of mind, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws

21,Rap,"I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs impossible‚Äô
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal

I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs impossible‚Äô
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You‚Äôre floating freely, no emotion

Got a fuckin‚Äô mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

Pray to God to intervene on all the sorrow I've seen

Nothing can stop you, if that's your type of persona

Son I just slapped my bitch
Came to my crib 'bout half past six
Kid's in shitty diapers, no food was fixed
I was like, ""Yo bitch - why ain't no food fixed?""
She on the phone with her friend talkin bout dick
I snatched the receiver from that bitch like CLICK
She got all excited, tryin to throw fit
Swung at me then I swung back - BITCH!

What you in fo'? It happened in the club
With some thugs I was at the bar, smokin bud, hollerin at love
Ladybug was playin in my peachfuzz, she was
Talkin hot fudge, can't nobody do it like she does
In the hot tub - didn't know her man was in the club
And honey dove never mentioned that she had a scrub
It must have been the drugs or the alcohol buzz, had me
Shootin my game like a thirty-eight snub baby
Let's cut a rug, that's when I felt a shove
What the blood, dude actin like he won the Golden Gloves
I get one for holdin grudge, but if this kid throw a slug
I'mma throw a slug - that's how we be rollin cuz
I see this dud tryin to play me like a pair of Lugz
Big John Stud, Goldschlager in a golden mug
What you in fo'?
.. {*jail interlude*} ..

I'm locked down for tryin to hold my block down since a shorty
The Old Earth was like, ""Street put the Glock down""
I was raised in slums, love how the gun sounds
And now I got one - c'mon, who wanna front now?
Sunup to sundown, ready for showdown
Whoever wanna throw down, the gangsters better slow down
Wake up, before you be in a cell with forty of us
(What you in fo'?) In for murder over money love and lust
(What you in fo'?) In for life, don't let me tell you twice
I might bang you twice and take double the life
What you in fo'?

Jail status - get up
Wash a nigga mattress faggot, you heard about me right?
Pass off them packages cat, you gotta eat to live
Meet the crib; got a hundred starvin niggas in here big
So pop off, drugs that's props, bring in
Glocks we call 'em oxes
Be a real live nigga, swing mops and shit, take over shit
Fuck the C.O.'s, aiyyo Boo, I need clothes
Slide brokers where phones get hid
Fuck with Russians and Latins
The most powerful marble black slipper style
Goin out thrashin niggas, kicks get thrown
Big sizes, sleep in your boots, 4000 rugged F Troops
Notarized wigs, lay six months
That's alright dog, make it home Lord
Heard you admit it in the box, slid it under walls
Bang monster anger
Bop through the halls with bangers
Live God like the Abbot of all chambers..

Tell me is you ready is you really ready
They ain't really ready they ain't never ready

Now I'm coming heavy

I hope you ready, cause its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around

Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping everytime I'm stepping out
And if you step outside your face we pop up right in front of your house

Niggas think because we conscious we don't really get it popping
They forgot we from the bottom
They forgot we had to fight for every nickel, every dollar
Before the money and the power
You could ask my nigga Powers I've been putting in these hours
Plotting domination now the whole world is ours
Tell me why they hating, its cause of what I'm making
And if you a little patient its gon' be what I'm taking
They got me mistaken
Critics try to box me
I feel like Rocky when it come to paparazzi
Somebody stop me, fucking up my kamikaze
I'm on my 47 shit, like how could you not see
Cause we dropping jewels I said we dropping jewels
Temper rising cools prolly see me on the news
Joey got the juice, finally got this nigga loose
Now while I'm free to speak free my nigga Shmurda too
I'm feeling like Victor Cruz a giant from New York
I'm lacing up the boots then I'm going fucking long

Bitch I'm the bomb even HOV said it
Though I never signed to ROC and no I don't regret it
You know I'm coming for the top you see me getting bigger
How can you sign if you know you're tryna beat a nigga
When I made it to his office I was seventeen
Like forty floors up I grew a pair of wings
In that moment man I knew I could do anything
Feeling like a young Simba can't wait to be a king
And I never lost my hunger man I stayed hungry
If we started talking numbers man they wouldn't love me
Man I'd rather keep the peace but its getting ugly
But fuck it what I'm about to say is what they didn't want me
60k first week for the Bada$$
200k to this day I know you niggas mad
With the 80/20 split my nigga do the math
My nigga Kirk just outsold Troy Ave
Now they sleep we 'bout to hit 'em with the NYCK next
Got these niggas bread hurt, Limp Bizkit
Its crunch time had to go and get his shit wreck
Got the ninjas on deck and bitches in check
And that's a shot to anybody man I don't feel you
Steezy told me to go hard and niggas ain't hear you
I see the whole future clearer and I'm near it too
And if you really break a leg, I hope they still will cheer you

Don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
An still be straight (still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral

Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16
That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo

I got the steel magnum, braggin, leavin my toe tagged
As I get raggamuffin, no bluffin, the body bagged
Breaks all your bad habits, bad blood fanatics
Clean up the magic, chrome startin up static
Greed means that you die quick, click the vision
Greed lies anmbition, five slugs for the mission
Seven cause you go to the heaven or hell and dwell
To meet your maker, but you met the shotgun shell
Buckshots sting like bees, I smoke trees
On the hilltops, clubshops and chilling overseas
Take in the breeze, Mr. Freeze squeeze the trigger
Killa G's got you week in the knees, to take it ea-sy!

Steel Magnolia
Magnificent guns bust when 'Uzi Weighs a Ton'
And yo' Glock spits, consecutive rounds shot from clips
Spells murder, sound synonymous to burner
Leave niggas ass up, gaspin for air, front seats of truck
So who the fuck want me to press on they luck, bastard they son
When gats start to hum and whole crowds begin to run
Annihilation, destroyin all expectations
Have relatives embrace your Harlem hopital, we all patient
5 foot 6, concealed steel, pop more grip
With fixed sights that drifted to right, triggers light
So relinquish son, I'm to the finish, and you acknowledge
Couldn't pop a clutch or light a skyrocket, nigga stop it!
Steel Magnolia

Steel Magnolia, bury ya, six niggas carry ya
To your final rest area
What you worried though, you ain't above that with a slug
And your chest beats, blowin out your back, take it easy
To your eulogy, open heart surgery
Emergency, 911, come in a hurry
From the Hills to the Polo realms, stackin the bills
I put you under my lo-lo, hit my switch, then kill
A bitch nigga steppin on my toes, fuck foes and hoes
Get stuck in the ass like Pete Rose
I suppose you wanna get wild and throw blows, you chose
To get you nose your broke, in a thick cloud of smoke
You're like a fat joint, I'm takin a toke, I'm like coke
But you ain't smilin, feelin erratic, a fuckin addict

68,Rap,"Dr. Dre:
All you see is the sun, reflecting off of the gun
Ready for the showdown, to go down, at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
Polish the gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old 45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots to make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sounds of hooves
Sound like a thousand wolves
I cock back, with the toast in the holster and frooze
I pose as a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside and leave early
Just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
Eminem:
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name is Slim
You want revenge then don't shoot
I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you
Chorus:
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
Life ain't fun, when your on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
Life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
Dr. Dre:
He was shady, could see it by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
The shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
{Eminem: You need bullets, hurry up run}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
He pulled two at the same time and stood stunned
{Eminem: Go ahead shoot me, but I'm not the one you want}
I figured he was telling the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gonna do, it's on you
Eminem:
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group
{Dre: the Chronic}
Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it (Who)
Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two
Dr. Dre:
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rode two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Eminem:
Dre here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
{Dre: Let's shoot him in the kneecaps, he'll never see it coming}
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission, is to get him to stop laying eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
Dr. Dre:
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swinging doors in, and started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singing
It sounded like a G Thang, and a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringing
I said it's Dre's Day and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls an AK
Hollow tips started flying every which way
Eminem:
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gage
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled
Chorus:
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
When life ain't fun, when your on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
Life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your ride

Visions of home, the streets that I roam, it‚Äôs been awhile
Raise me like the father I never had, I‚Äôm still your child
And though I‚Äôve grown in ways that you‚Äôve never known
I‚Äôve ventured into the world, I‚Äôve moved out all on my own
I‚Äôm doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone
Seen shit you wouldn‚Äôt believe, I write em down in these poems
And put them out for the world, I know you listening too
Heard you saying shit about me I hope the shit isn‚Äôt true
Man look at the shit I came from, this narrow point of view
How you hatin‚Äô on a nigga that wanted it more than you?
I ran through them spots with you and fucked the same bitches too
And just because I ride with you, I scrap with them niggas too
Came back for them niggas too, ain‚Äôt no trappin nigga, it‚Äôs true
Yet they play me on repeat because I rap for them niggas too
See I started with nothing but passion and then I blew
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view

Visions of home, visions of home
Visions of home, visions of home

Yeah, visions of home, this is my zone
This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song
This for my cousin Ricky damn nigga it‚Äôs been too long
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin‚Äô but to each his own
Gotta feed yo‚Äô self, smoke a little weed just to ease yourself
Fuck the whole world, I don‚Äôt need your help
You‚Äôre the reason why momma had those rocks
All my niggas never even had no pops
Remember that? Ya remember that?
If ya don‚Äôt, double back
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street
But I‚Äôm still where the trouble at, where the trouble at?
That‚Äôs ‚Äòcause my folks there, what it look like if I don‚Äôt go there?
I‚Äôm dead wrong, it‚Äôs been way too long, long

Dreamin' of a fire

Uh, my mama used to pray that she'd see me in Yale
It's fucked up she gotta see me in jail
On the visit with Lil Papi, it hurt even though I seemed to be well
They got a smoker with a key to my cell, damn
And even worst, my judge black don't wanna see me do well
It's either that or black people for sale
Gave me two to four years like, ""Fuck your life, meet me in hell""
And let it burn like Lucifer, you look even stupider
Tryna impress them people in power when power abusin' us
For 44 dollars a hour, you coward they using ya
Is it self-hate that made you send me upstate?
This where the so-called ""real niggas"" sweeping up for cupcakes
And that's your phone time, if you ain't got no money, you ain't online
Hey call your son, call your daughter just to wish them more prime
Oh God, don't let them streets get a hold of 'em
Your daughter fuckin' now, it's gon be a cold summer
Your son trapping, and your homie giving O's to him
And if he fuck that paper up, he puttin' holes through him
And you just wanna make it home, so you can show it to him
And them people ain't finna give no parole to ya
They want blood, we all hangin' with a noose on our neck

And he won't make it to the wake unless he give 'em a check

And they got us warring for our freedom
See my brother blood on the pavement
How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
Uhh, trauma
When them drugs got a hold of your mama
And the judge got a hold on your father
Go to school, bullet holes in the locker

Ain't no PTSDs, them drugs keep it at ease
They shot that boy 20 times when they could've told him just freeze
Could've put him in a cop car, but they let him just bleed
The ambulance, they coming baby, just breathe
That's what the old lady said when she screamed
This nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th
And in the 13th amendment, it don't say that we kings
They say that we legally slaves if we go to the bing
They told Kaep' stand up if you wanna play for a team
And all his teammates ain't saying a thing (Stay woke)
If you don't stand for nothing, you gon' fall for something
And in the 60's, if you kneeled, you'd prolly be killed
But they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal
Kill your account, look where money get spilled
Check it, and they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal

How many times you send me to jail to know that I won't fail
Invisible shackles on the king, 'cause shit, I'm on bail
I went from selling out arenas, now shit, I'm on sale
Them cold nights starting to feel like hell, uhh
Watching a black woman take my freedom
Almost made me hate my people
When they label you felon, it's like they telling you they not equal
11 years going to court knowing they might keep you or drive you crazy

Call everybody, ""Nigga,"" and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, ""Nigga,"" then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?

It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear

With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, ""All Lives Matter,"" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, ""Nigga,"" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine

Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not racist","with all due respect i dont have pity for you black niggas thats the way i put it ‚Äî emma thompson @emmathugonbiscuit december 26 2015

Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along

I'm young but I'm a grown man
Takin' thangs into my own hands, I'm tryin' to own land
But life a twist ya like a twister, get twisted with this
It seems on but its off, I keep missin' this shit
I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink they dip
Its hard to hang on, but I can't let go
Smokin' on my last breath
Blow out life whats left is death
Now I can go wrong or I can G or make a right
Whatever way that I turn, its still death after life
And if it don't discourage me, I ain't got nuthin' to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But I learn cuz I see, and I earn cuz I G
But, these problems probably havin' niggas prayin' to see
At an early age so at an early stage in life

Gettin' jealous cuz my niggas got this rap game sold up

Get around, my life won't change for the good
It seems soon I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me?
Ayo Daz, you da soldier would you die for me?
The hood tradition's got a lot of niggas killed for dumb shit
The OG's think they run shit, the youngsters control shit
Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite
Be siding with the drama when the dogg fight, street fight

You ready to give up?
You ready to end it all?
Don't do it dog, word up
I don't care if you black, white, Latin, Asian, whatever
We all go through pain
When you can't think, use your soul baby

Preliminary discussions is over with, the verdict is in
I took the rap throne back
I reigned like krills in '87, my name is on the map
It feels like a razor down the middle of my back
They slept on my lyrical ability to blow
Gave another nigga credit for inventing my flow
I'm a child of God, witness the rising son
From the cradle to the grave, I remain number one
This thing of ours, got competition taking red showers
Grieving mothers calling 1-800-Flowers
My repertoire burn your ashes in the urn
Is it God or money that really make the world turn?
Grab your gun, separate the ones from the real funds
Inhale deep and hold it in your lungs
The streets was requesting some original LL
A soundtrack for niggas that was raised in {hell}
They looking for a leader that can guide 'em through the maze
Smoke filled rooms, breathing in purple haze
Po' nigga's on the bricks his whole life
He ain't got nothin' to live for, so fucking living right
But if you stay in the rain like hurricane
Gold melts down but it don't fear flames
Toxic, lethal, psychologically evil
Genocide was committed on the black people
And the ghetto is a trap with glass walls
Should I sell drugs, be a rap thug, or play ball?
We end up in the grave anyway
The average cat and LL Cool J
It's a never-ending cycle, life and death
Until then may my mic stay blessed, to the death

I can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?
I can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind
I can't think, I want the paper, that's just the bottom line
I can't think, mo' murder every day around the way
I can't think, I'd rather get paid and parlay
I can't think, it's all about survival God
You know the epilogue by James Todd

Put your life on the line, you running out of time
The coroner's calling, she know she on a nigga mind
Amongst the dogs, real cats is hard to find
Even a nigga moms hate it when he start to shine
Get the money and run, dodge the devil and his sons
Spit powerful parables like a sermon has begun
Fuck the turntables up, leave the DJ awestruck
Attitude is what, keep the razor blade tucked
Too much flossing'll get your reputation touched
Too much rapping'll get your big mouth shut
Protect your neck nigga, you'll get it in the gut
You wearing a vest? What if you get your throat cut
Sold your soul for a dollar, now you having bad luck
Used to keep a bad bitch in the crib baggin' up
Player here, player there, nigga turned you out
But never told you beware
Never told you that black love supposed to be shared
And you never judge a woman by the texture of her hair
Fancy cars and gold teeth, G-strings and things
The almighty dollar replace the wedding ring
The Ark of the Covenant was held by a king
I ain't trading my soul in for skins and chrome rims

I can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?
I can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind

Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it!
The dawn, of a new millennium, came to pass
The world revolves around sex or cash
The black man's motto, ""Kiss my ass!""
Shorties in kindergarten are strapped, ready to blast
All I ever seen was killers and dope fiends
From FEDS Magazine to the heart of killer Queens
Bronx and Brooklyn and everything up in between
No matter what, you always got a Judas on your team
Giving it to the world and I'm telling it like it is
Tossing lyrical daggers and sending 'em in your wig
Know where the body's buried, I ain't saying where it is
Raised inside the ghetto, but dammit I wanna live
The legendary master of lyrical combat
But ain't no competition, ain't nobody to go at
So I'ma take the time and spit a universal verse
Hit the streets with a blessing and erase the curse

I can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?

We doing it with L....(Laughs)....Go head baby. Who do ya luv baby?

How you doin', miss? My name is L, I'm from Queens
I heard about your man, he like to lace you with cream
Dolce Gabbana, Moschino with Donna jeans
But he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend
He be playin' like a Willie 'cause he dress ya dove
Never knowin' that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin love, Duke is weak then he fallin asleep
You on the phone wit your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh

Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

Jew-els and Cristal got him actin' funny style
He ain't watchin' you, he rather watch his money pile
Can't protect treasures when it's in a glass house
Soon as he turn the corner I'mma turn that ass out
Full blown, frontin' in the 6 with the chrome
Yo B, why you leave your honey all alone with me?
Just because you blessed with cash
Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You got to try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love

Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

Who do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)
Who do you love? Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

So what you got the cash flow in escrow, damn
But your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam
Man made the money, money never made the man
You still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand
See, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown
Rock roller with so much ice your cap's polar
I got her smokin' beedies, modeling bikinis
Pushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me
I keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn
Teaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned
Don't get it twisted, getting money ain't wrong
But she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone

Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
Let's put him all in the front of the store
So I'm on break, next to the ""No Smoking"" sign
With a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle, you can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude, lock yourself in a room
Doin' 5 beats a day for 3 summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob, at the same time
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
Life my love, that's not mine
""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball, never one to fall
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall till 12 when my schedule had said 9
Puttin' them pants on shelves, waitin' patiently I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God, ""Man, why'd you have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!
(Aww, man, this pressure)

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I 'member havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me
A&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

Bottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm Big Meech

Fine, you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up

And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a townhouse
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse

When Pac hung with Suge before that rat tat tat tat nose rings
And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, slow swing, tip foes, and chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up that's my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap

Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls, before them blunts, got crunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Mama I want to sing
But mama I want to trick, and mama I'm sucking dick now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82, me and you like Tony Toni Tone
(Yeah, yeah) Like this, East Point and we gone

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""No not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat
Like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat
So we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

Accept some friends of ridicule

But in 3A sat Mitzi Dupree
She said, ""Hi I am Mitzi the queen of the ping pong
Where you going boy""

She said, ""I'm moving on""
I thought what is this
I cannot resist, here she is

I said, ""I'm a singer in a band""
She said, ""Yeah I'm an entertainer""

She was going to a mining town
Way up north to do her show
I said, ""It must be cold up there""
She said, ""Depends on who you know""

I'm just a man, she made me feel
Like a king in my mind, I love you Mitzi Dupree

I said, ""What is this queen of the ping pong business""
She smiled, ""What do you think
It has no connection with China""
I said, ""Have another drink""
Well I knew right away
That I'd seen her act before
In a room behind a kitchen in Bangkok
And three or four times more in Singapore
She may not be the first
But I know she isn't the worst
She was mine but I ran out of time

Wearing my best dress

You look so angry when you sleep
Your face a troubled frown
So I will smooth your furrowed brow
As I lay you in the ground

I'll kiss you once for life
I'll kiss you twice for death
Hold you close for comfort

And as the mourners pass me
I will smile and wave
Thank them for their sympathy
And tell them I'll be brave
But once the wake is over
And I'm drunk and feeling fine
I'll go out there and find me
Another boy to pass the time
As we're dancing cheek to cheek
And the lights are laid low
I'll request this song for you
Laying in the ground below
Once the song is over
And it's time to go to bed
I'll leave him on the dance floor
And return to you instead

I'll kiss you twice for death

Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming it over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
And songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is

And now as I wonder
My thoughts ever stray

In old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while
I kissed the smile
Upon her face
For it was siesta
And we were so gay
South of the border
Down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whisperd manana
For our tomorrow never came

I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight
She kneeled to pray

99,Soul,"When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
Baby

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love
From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss
Sugar, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...alright

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love
Ladies and gentlemen
I have the pleasure to present on my album
Mr. Dizzy Gillespie...Blow!
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!
Do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your lo-o-ove
Oh, I don't care how long it might take
Cause I know the woman for me, you I'll make
And I will not deny myself the chance
Of being part of what feels like the right romance
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
Oh yea

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Girl, I've got some chocolate kisses for your loving; baby
Oh yea
Do you want some candy?
Do you want some honey suckle?
Do you want some chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you?
Girl, if you felt everything you heard me say
Turn your feelings in your heart back to me right away
And I'll get it

Do I do (do I do)
What you do (what you do)
When I do my love to you
Do I do (do I do)
What you do (what you do)
When I do my love...Nate!
I know the record is about to end
But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So if you don‚Äôt like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothing but a penny and you'll have a cough
I know I cannot rhyme cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I ha ha ha ha h-ha ha ha

Now everybody's talking about the jive is in...
Well I know I've got something for your body...

Cause I...

Earl's playing by himself, man!
Earl's playing by himself, man!
Earl's playing by himself, man!
Dennis playing by himself, man!
