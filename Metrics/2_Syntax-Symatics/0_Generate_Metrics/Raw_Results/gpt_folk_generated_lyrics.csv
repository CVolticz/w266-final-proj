0,0,Folk,"I know how it feels to be head over heels
To be lost in true love and the light of the moon
When everything seems to be coming up roses
And every word seems to be rhyming with June
Suddenly, all of your dreams have come true
Happiness lives in your heart
Then out of nowhere, one becomes two
And everything seems to be falling apart
Is it love? When your heart, feels like it's broken
Is it love? And you just can't take anymore
Is it love? When there's nothing left to be spoken
Is it love? And there's nothing worth listening for
Is it love? ooh ooh
I know what it means to get caught up in dreams
And in prayers that are answered with each passing day
When loving and laughter are birds of a feather
And sharing and caring is one simple way
You know you'll never be alone
That someone will always be near
Then you turn around when your best friend is gone
Oh, where do they go? When they just disappear?
Is it love? When your heart, feels like it's broken
Is it love? And you just can't take anymore
Is it love? When the good times have all been forgotten
Is it love? And you fear there won't be anymore
Is it love? ooh ooh
There's no answer, there seems to be nothing to say
In your anger would you even hear anyway
It was magic but somehow you've broken the spell
It was heaven and somehow it's turned into hell
Is it love? When you know that your heart has been broken
Is it love? And you just can't take it anymore
Is it love? When you feel more than you could imagine
Is it love? Now there's nothing that's worth living for
Is it love? ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh","i know how it feels to be head over heels to be lost in true love with your male-girlfriend?

6,6,Folk,"The old folks don't talk much
They talk so slowly when they do
They are rich they are poor
Their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two
Their homes all smell of time
Of old photographs
And an old fashioned song
Though you may live in town
You live so far away
When you've lived too long
Have they laughed too much
Do their dry voices crack
Talking of things gone by
Have they cried too much
A tear or two still always seems
To cloud the eye
They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock oh so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you
The old folks dream no more
Their books have gone to sleep
The piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead
And no more do they sing on a sunday afternoon
The old folks move no more
Their world become to small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out a window
Or else sit it a chair
Or else they stay in bed
And if they still go out
Arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning chill
Its to have a good cry
To say their last goodbye
To one who's older still
And then they go home
To the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock so so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you
The old folks never die
They just put down their heads
And go to sleep one day
They will hold each others hands
Like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway
And the other will remain
Just sitting in a room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now
The song has died away
And echo's all around
You'll see them as they walk
Through the sun filled parks
Where children run and play
It hurst to much to smile
It hurts so much
But life goes on for still another day
As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock oh so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you
The old old silver clock
Thats hanging on the wall
That waits for us all","the old folks dont talk much they talk so slowly when they do they are rich and then they dont say shit) - Jonny on Valor ""I was so used to the air going away, I didnt see much I could say.

8,8,Folk,"When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chittlins'
When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street!
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely!
Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on!
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down
We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says ""Pork Pie Hat Bar""
And there's black babies dancing...
Tonight!","when charlie speaks of lester you know someone great has gone the sweetest swinging music man ever, lester lester, I hope that I saw his cheek again with the night I played for him.""

9,9,Folk,"You thought that it could never happen

Between the sailboat and the drain
Between the newsreel and your tiny pane

Where are you Judy? Where are you Anne?
Where are the paths your heroes came?

14,14,Folk,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes

Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel

Enough about me, let's talk about you
What do you think of me
You must feel such gratitude
That you will get to read
My autobiography
My life doesn't have a very good plot
Guess I'll have to lie a lot
Should be easy to make things up
There's no one left to call my bluff
A lot of my old friends have passed on
The rest did drugs and their memory's gone
So I'll write my own history
In my autobiography
I'll say I slept with a Kennedy
Don't remember which one
They all looked the same to me
Or they did when we got done
Maybe they'll film it for TV
I wonder who they'll cast as me
Should be somebody I look like
Sigourney Weaver'd be all right
Gonna be hard to deal with fame
Once the whole world knows my name
But I'll stay humble and grateful to
All the little people like you
A thousand pages more of me

I was holding back from crying
He saw my complications
And he mirrored me back simplified
And we laughed how our perfection
Would always be denied
""Heart and humor and humility""
He said ""Will lighten up your heavy load""
I left him for the refuge of the roads

I fell in with some drifters
Cast upon a beachtown
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And I wound up fixing dinner
For them and Boston Jim
I well up with affection
Thinking back down the roads to then
The nets were overflowing
In the Gulf of Mexico
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads

There was spring along the ditches
There were good times in the cities
Oh radiant happiness
It was all so light and easy
Till I started analyzing
And I brought on my old ways
A thunderhead of judgment was
Gathering in my gaze
And it made most people nervous
They just didn't want to know
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads

I pulled off into a forest
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Like a wheel of fortune
I heard my fate turn turn turn
And I went running down a white sand road
I was running like a white-assed deer
Running to lose the blues
To the innocence in here
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
Muscular with gods and sungold
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads

In a highway service station
Over the month of June
Was a photograph of the earth
Taken coming back from the moon
And you couldn't see a city
On that marbled bowling ball
Or a forest or a highway
Or me here least of all
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms
Or this baggage overload

Lookin' for the sun

Outside a whiskey basin

For him to spend
The winter on his own
Nothing much for him to do tomorrow
Just a matter of survival
Another friendly fight
In a life chocked full of fun

I was sittin' in Miami, pouring blended whiskey down
When this old gray, black gentleman was cleaning up the lounge
There wasn't anyone around, except this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watching Ironside on TV
Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
""Ever had a drink of watermelon wine,"" he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn't answer back
""Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine.""
He said, ""Women think about themselves, when men-folk ain't around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down.""
He said, ""I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine.""
""Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still to young to hate.""
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line
About old dogs and children and watermelon wine

All around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

When the sun comes shining as I was strolling
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there
And that sign said ""No trespassin'""
But on the other side .... it didn't say nothin!
Now that side was made for you and me!

This land is your land, and this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple
Near the relief office - I see my people
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'
If this land's still made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Nobody living can ever stop me
As I go walking that freedom highway;
Nobody living can ever make me turn back

And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity""

And drug her down to the river side
And there I threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

See now, the leaves, how they die
Love needs no reason for ending

What ever love ever was, never lasted too long
Maybe the best of our life was the beautiful dreamin'
That conscience was destined to crumble like castles of sand
All there is left of our love is a little girl's laughter
Let her keep making believing as long as she can

Is it the same over there where you found your new friends
Sometimes at night I still wake up and feel something missing
Maybe I'll never believe in forever again

78,78,Folk,"TIME GONE BY
By Carole King
The rebel cry of desolation
To which we used to hearken
Echoes now in isolation
As the skies in fury darken
A thousand acts of desecration
Hundreds more continue
When y'know that you are all creation
You're gonna fight them with all that's in you
I remember time gone by
When peace and hope and dreams were high
We followed inner visions and touched the sky
Now we who still believe won't let them die
Waters dammed to overflowing
Like tears brimming over in our eyes
Sometimes it's so hard to keep on going
When promises turn to lies
Go ahead, give into confussion
And put aside your ideals too
Soon you'll see only illusion
Don't care who's hurt
As long as it's not you
CHORUS
Soemtimes a leader emerges
And is followed for a while
Doesn't matter what he encourages
Just as long as he's got style
Young ones conceived in a passion
Of directions we thought enlighted
Grown up they follow the mood in fashion
But beneathe their bravado
You know they're frightened
CHORUS","time gone by by carole king the rebel cry of desolation to which we used to rub our feet.

Came in through the window
In the night
When the moon was in the yard
He took her hand in his and
Shook the long hair
From his neck
And he told her
She'd been working much too hard
It was true that ever since the day
Her crazy man had passed away
To the land of poet's pride
She laughed and talked a lot
With new people on the block
But always at evening time she cried

And here's to the dawn of their days
La-la-di-di-di
La-la-la-la
La-da-da-da
La-ah, ah

She moved her head
A little down on the bed
Until it rested softly on his knee
And there she dropped her smile
And there she sighed awhile
And told him all the sadness
Of those years that numbered three
""Well you know I think my fate's belated
Because of all the hours I waited
For the day when I'd no longer cry
I get myself to work by eight
But oh, was I born too late
And do you think I'll fail
At every single thing I try?""

And here's to the dawn of their days

He just put his arm around her
And that's the way I found her
Eight months later to the day
The lines of a smile erased
The tear tracks upon her face
A smile could linger, even stay

With his gay bride of flowers
The prince of the hours
Of her lifetime

93,93,Folk,"I remember Richard Nixon back in '74
And the final scene at the White House door
And the staff lined up to say good-bye
Tiny tear in his shifty little eye
He said, ""Nobody knows me
Nobody understands
These little people were good to me
Oh I'm gonna shake some hands
Somebody line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Want you to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up""

I looked like ashes and smelled like smoke
And I turned away from my loving kind
Tried to leave my body and live in my mind
But it's much too much emotion
To hold it in your hand

They gonna wear away the land

Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Want you to line 'em up, line 'em all up

And I've seen picket fences
And certain cowboy dances
I've gone lining up for shows
I've been safely placed in rows
Sure I know how it goes
Another day goes by, little time machine
I'm raking my brain over what it might mean
Just to claim the time and to turn away
Make today today

They go walking on down the aisles
Each re-engages
Stepping into the sun
I watch them turn like pages
One by one by one

But I fell in love last Friday evening
With the girl I saw on a bar room TV screen
Well I was just getting ready to get my hat
When she caught my eye, and I put it back
And I ordered myself couple of more shots and beers
The night that I fell in love with a roller derby queen
Around and round, a round and round
The meanest hunk of woman that anybody ever seen
Down in the arena
She was 5 foot 6, two fifteen
A beach blonde mama with a streak of mean
She knew how to knuckle and she knew how to scuffle and fight
And the roller derby program said
That she was built like a 'fridgerator with a head
Her fans called her Tuffy, but all her buddies called her Spike

Around and round, a round and round
The meanest hunk of woman that anybody ever seen

With this heavy duty woman I've been speaking of
Things were kinda bad, untill the day she skated into my life
Well she might be nasty, she might be fat
But I never met a person who would tell her that
She's my bleach blonde bomber, my heavy handed Hackensack sack mama

Told the wife to pack the bag
Forget about the plans we had
We're going east instead

Carried our bags to the hall

Begs so politely

I grabbed the wife and kids and ran

Please don't blame us

Scrambled up the mountain

Searching for her mum and dad
A thin dress was all she had
She held us tight
We looked far and wide
But nothing there
There was nothing left
We all broke down and wept
