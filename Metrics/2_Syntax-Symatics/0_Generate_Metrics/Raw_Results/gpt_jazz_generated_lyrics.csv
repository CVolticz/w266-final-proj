Or the tango is done with seafaring trash
Callous and brash, fresh off the ship
Or the tango is done as a dangerous dance
A treacherous step and if one should trip
The frail body breaks with a snap and a twist
And a gold watch slips onto a thick tattooed wrist
And a gray merchant ship turns black in the sun
As it heaves to the East when the tango is done

Neatly arranged in gleaming glass trays

Forever around the edge of the vase

A tango and over and over it plays
Over it plays
Over it plays
A medieval tapestry hangs like a warning
A needlepoint forest of dark green and brown
The scene is the hunt, you will notice the hunter
He takes careful aim as your eye travels down
And finally rests upon the real victim
Lying quite still in a silk dressing gown
Lying quite still at the edge of the carpet
One arm flung out for the peacocks to peck
Blending in well with the blue and green background
Except for the bright scarlet sash round the neck
He was a collector of beautiful strangers
And life was a party right up to the end
The door always opened to love and loves dangers
Though dead, a lover, a stranger, a friend

That at heart you're really not so bad
If I add, your funny face appeals to me
Please don't' think I've suddenly gone mad
You have all the qualities of Peter Pan;
I'd go far before I'd find a sweeter pan
And yet
I love your funny face
Your sunny, funny face;
For you're a cutie
With more than beauty
You've got a lot
Of personality N.T
A thousand laughs I've found
In having you around
Though you're not Gloria Swanson
For worlds I'd not replace
Your sunny, funny face
Needn't tell me that I'm not so pretty, dear
When my looking glass and I agree
In the contest at Atlantic City, dear
Miss America I'd never be
Truth to tell, though, you're not such a bad lot yourself;
As a Paul Swan, you are not so hot yourself
And yet
I love your funny face
Your sunny, funny face;
You can't repair it
So I declare it
Is quite all right
Like Ronald Colman?
So's your old man!
Yet it's very clear
I'm glad when you are near
Though you're no Handsome Harry
For worlds I'd not replace
Your sunny funny face
I love that funny face
That sunny, funny face;
Thought it upsets one, in time, it gets one
That's true, for you
Have personality for two
Those eyes! Those nose! Those cheek!
Won't make a movie sheikh
But though you're not patootie
For worlds I'd not replace
Your sunny, funny face
I love your funny face
Your sunny, funny face;
You never bother
About your father
Have you no shame?
You're just a mutt and nothing but!
Yet when you wag your tail
You'll never be for sale
Though you're no Rin Tin Tin, dear
For worlds I'd not replace

On merely this: a look, a kiss

Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

Or was it that a nightingale

There was still some stardust on my sleeve

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a man I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a robin on the wing

And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
To throw myself off

Left standing in the lurch, at a church
With people saying
""My God that's tough, she stood him up""

We may as well go home

I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Oh, if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? what do we do?

Looking back over the years
What ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide my tears

And at sixty five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day (cried, and cried all day)

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other

Just casually glanced into a window so high
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!
Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!
Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!""
Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!""
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!
So they put her away in a dungeon
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!
But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried

98,98,Jazz,"My heart is like a hand-me-down made soft by older brothers
My body's like my father's house, the sin of generations
Damn the circumstances
Life is hard enough
Damn the bones that rattle
Faith is good enough
You shook the ground beneath my feet, my hopes turned into water
The house came crashing down on me in the early morning hours
Damn the circumstances
Life is hard enough
Damn the bones that rattle
Faith is good enough
Now the lines are drawn and we sleep in the rags and dust
Where all good will has gone and the dreams we had went bust
Damn the circumstances
Life is hard enough
Damn the bones that rattle
Faith is good enough","my heart is like a handmedown made soft by older brothers my bodys like my fathers would be made of.""

By the fire
The long day is over
The wind is gone
Asleep at dawn
The embers burn on
With no reprise
The sun will rise
The long day is over","feeling tired by the fire the long day is over the wind is gone asleep at the fire.

Youre the best at this! And if you do you will find you will be much loved, much loved. (One last love letter to go to her) And I pray you will take my heart and take mine from me.
