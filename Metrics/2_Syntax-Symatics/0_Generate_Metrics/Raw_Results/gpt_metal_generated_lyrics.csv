""Mi nomine Baphomet"", come dance with me
Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites

Fire rising, racing in your blood
Possessed, naïve, his service is done

Bad omen of the goat
Bloody blasphemy


Sinister's the word as the demon's take their fill
An orgy's taking place, human blood will spill
An act of worship as they conceive the ghouls
Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes
The ceremony is sure to be cursed
They wait for his blessings but down comes the worst
Their bodies, soulless, a corpse from the grave

9,9,Metal,"It is sad to think that the first few people on earth needed no books, movies, games or music to inspire cold-blooded murder. The day that Cain bashed his brother Abel's brains in, the only motivation he needed was his own human disposition to violence. Whether you interpret the Bible as literature or as the final word of whatever God may be, Christianity has given us an image of death and sexuality that we have based our culture around. A half-naked dead man hangs in most homes and around our necks, and we have just taken that for granted all our lives. Is it a symbol of hope or hopelessness? The world's most famous murder-suicide was also the birth of the death icon – the blueprint for celebrity. Unfortunately, for all of their inspiring morality, nowhere in the Gospels is intelligence praised as a virtue
A lot of people forget or never realize that I started my band as a criticism of these very issues of despair and hypocrisy. The name Marilyn Manson has never celebrated the sad fact that America puts killers on the cover of Time magazine, giving them as much notoriety as our favorite movie stars. From Jesse James to Charles Manson, the media, since their inception, have turned criminals into folk heroes. They just created two new ones when they plastered those dip-shits Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris' pictures on the front of every newspaper. Don't be surprised if every kid who gets pushed around has two new idols
We applaud the creation of a bomb whose sole purpose is to destroy all of mankind, and we grow up watching our president's brains splattered all over Texas. Times have not become more violent. They have just become more televised. Does anyone think the Civil War was the least bit civil? If television had existed, you could be sure they would have been there to cover it, or maybe even participate in it, like their violent car chase of Princess Di. Disgusting vultures looking for corpses, exploiting, fucking, filming and serving it up for our hungry appetites in a gluttonous display of endless human stupidity
When it comes down to who's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you'll hit someone who's guilty. We're the people who sit back and tolerate children owning guns, and we're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them. I think it's terrible when anyone dies, especially if it is someone you know and love. But what is more offensive is that when these tragedies happen, most people don't really care any more than they Would about the season finale of Friends or The Real World. I was dumbfounded as I watched the media snake right in, not missing a teardrop, interviewing the parents of dead children, televising the funerals. Then came the witch hunt
Man's greatest fear is chaos. It was unthinkable that these kids did not have a simple black-and-white reason for their actions. And so a scapegoat was needed. I remember hearing the initial reports from Littleton, that Harris and Klebold were wearing makeup and were dressed like Marilyn Manson, whom they obviously must worship, since they were dressed in black. Of course, speculation snowballed into making me the poster boy for everything that is bad in the world. These two idiots weren't wearing makeup, and they weren't dressed like me or like goths. Since Middle America has not heard of the music they did listen to (KMFDM and Rammstein, among others), the media picked something they thought was similar
Responsible journalists have reported with less publicity that Harris and Klebold were not Marilyn Manson fans – that they even disliked my music. Even if they were fans, that gives them no excuse, nor does it mean that music is to blame. Did we look for James Huberty's inspiration when he gunned down people at McDonald's? What did Timothy McVeigh like to watch? What about David Koresh, Jim Jones? Do you think entertainment inspired Kip Kinkel, or should we blame the fact that his father bought him the guns he used in the Springfield, Oregon, murders? What inspires Bill Clinton to blow people up in Kosovo? Was it something that Monica Lewinsky said to him? Isn't killing just killing, regardless if it's in Vietnam or Jonesboro, Arkansas? Why do we justify one, just because it seems to be for the right reasons? Should there ever be a right reason? If a kid is old enough to drive a car or buy a gun, isn't he old enough to be held personally responsible for what he does with his car or gun? Or if he's a teenager, should someone else be blamed because he isn't as enlightened as an eighteen-year-old?
America loves to find an icon to hang its guilt on. But, admittedly, I have assumed the role of Antichrist; I am the Nineties voice of individuality, and people tend to associate anyone who looks and behaves differently with illegal or immoral activity. Deep down, most adults hate people who go against the grain. It's comical that people are naive enough to have forgotten Elvis, Jim Morrison and Ozzy so quickly. All of them were subjected to the same age-old arguments, scrutiny and prejudice. I wrote a song called ""Lunchbox,"" and some journalists have interpreted it as a song about guns. Ironically, the song is about being picked on and fighting back with my Kiss lunch box, which I used as a weapon on the playground. In 1979, metal lunch boxes were banned because they were considered dangerous weapons in the hands of delinquents. I also wrote a song called ""Get Your Gunn."" The title is spelled with two n's because the song was a reaction to the murder of Dr. David Gunn, who was killed in Florida by pro-life activists while I was living there. That was the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being ""prolife."" The somewhat positive messages of these songs are usually the ones that sensationalists misinterpret as promoting the very things I am decrying
Right now, everyone is thinking of how they can prevent things like Littleton. How do you prevent AIDS, world war, depression, car crashes? We live in a free country, but with that freedom there is a burden of personal responsibility. Rather than teaching a child what is moral and immoral, right and wrong, we first and foremost can establish what the laws that govern us are. You can always escape hell by not believing in it, but you cannot escape death and you cannot escape prison
It is no wonder that kids are growing up more cynical; they have a lot of information in front of them. They can see that they are living in a world that's made of bullshit. In the past, there was always the idea that you could turn and run and start something better. But now America has become one big mall, and because of the Internet and all of the technology we have, there's nowhere to run. People are the same everywhere. Sometimes music, movies and books are the only things that let us feel like someone else feels like we do. I've always tried to let people know it's OK, or better, if you don't fit into the program. Use your imagination – if some geck from Ohio can become something, why can't anyone else with the willpower and creativity?
I chose not to jump into the media frenzy and defend myself, though I was begged to be on every single TV show in existence. I didn't want to contribute to these fameseeking journalists and opportunists looking to fill their churches or to get elected because of their self-righteous finger-pointing. They want to blame entertainment? Isn't religion the first real entertainment? People dress up in costumes, sing songs and dedicate themselves in eternal fandom. Everyone will agree that nothing was more entertaining than Clinton shooting off his prick and then his bombs in true political form. And the news – that's obvious. So is entertainment to blame? I'd like media commentators to ask themselves, because their coverage of the event was some of the most gruesome entertainment any of us have seen. I think that the National Rifle Association is far too powerful to take on, so most people choose Doom, The Basketball Diaries or yours truly. This kind of controversy does not help me sell records or tickets, and I wouldn't want it to. I'm a controversial artist, one who dares to have an opinion and bothers to create music and videos that challenge people's ideas in a world that is watered-down and hollow. In my work I examine the America we live in, and I've always tried to show people that the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us. So don't expect the end of the world to come one day out of the blue – it's been happening every day for a long time","it is sad to think that the first few people on earth needed no books, movies, or TV.

Shrouded by his stealth
Ignore him at your peril
He kills to heal himself

He marks you with precision
Corrupting all he touches
Salvation in your soul
Scourging you in silence
As he makes his incision
The venom's taking over
This tyrant takes his toll

Trapped inside the mind

Wizard on a weekend
Willing on a weekday
Are you kidding come on
Fed up with the prepay
Looking for a keepsake
I'm no emerald liar
Dying for a card up my sleeve
I'm the gambling kind
For higher stakes and brighter takes I'll play
I'll make a deal with you, if all you want
Is not to leave love, to run 'em up
Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
Call when you can
Call me when you're close

Pretty magic
Got me good vibes
Thank God I ain't driving
Traffic vision
Blurred blue bleedin'
That's a black out ladder
It don't matter anyhow
I'm climbing
Keep my good vibes
And check coats for cool climates
In common we got
Good friends rolled light on split ends
Pretty magic
Traffic addicts
Now I don't really know where you stay at, can I get an address?
Never mind my phone dead forget it
I don't really know where to bake that, less you tryna get in
In which case... my phone dead, forget it
And I never answer calls when I'm in the kitchen
Cooking
It's just a thing
It's out
And I never call back when my friends all looking at me in the car
Cause it'd be all they wanna talk about
Oh you tryna to get a deal? A deal? A deal
Sorry on the real
But my eyes and my ears don't work well
And the floor keeps sliding out my heels
I can't feel 'em am I still dreaming?
Skull on the table a still life
Is this still life?
What's the meaning are we still dealing?
Feel like I can't act right
Oh right

And turn the table on you
Will you keep all that you came with and more?

Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you about his years


Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale


Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go


Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale


Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale","in a foreign field he lay lonely soldier, unknown grave on his dying words he prays, leaving you to wonder if the world was that hopeless again...

Of course I have my doubts
It's darker times and I can't always know what's ahead
So what are you going to do about it?
What can be done to resolve the situation?
Spit at what you don't like
Taste the bitter reactions
Force-feed the weight of the progress
Lead by the will of your might
You can't block out the sun
Won't block out the sun, no
It feels like everyone's eyes are on you
I can't be the enemy of myself
Everyone gets knocked down at some point in life
But it's how you deal with it to get back up
I can't live without nothing
Must have guidance and focus
Cast out all the suffering
Hope thrives only when active

64,64,Metal,"I awoke on impact
Under surveillance, from the camera eye
Searching high and low
The criminal mind, found at the scene of the crime
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it
She said she loved me
I guess I never knew
But do we ever, ever really know?
She said she'd meet me, on the other side
But I knew right then, I'd never find her

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No more nightmares, I've seen them all
From the day I was born, they've haunted my every move
Every open hand's there to push and shove
No time for love, it doesn't matter
She made a difference
I guess she had a way
Of making every night seem bright as day
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light
She must have lied, cause she never said goodbye

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I need to forget her face, I see it still
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No chance for contact
There's no raison d'etre
My only hope is one day I'll forget
The pain of knowing what can never be
With or without love, it's all the same to me

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love

He carries along
From a distant place, he's on his way
He'll bring decay
(Don't move along cause things they will go wrong
The end is getting closer day by day)
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight
Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for starlight, we wait for the moon
The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
We're getting nowhere
We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
The sacred halls empty and cold
The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome
We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight
It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall
Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out
We don't regret it
So many men have failed, but now he's gone
Go out and get it
The madman's head, it shall be thine
We don't regret it
That someone else dies hidden in disguise
Go out and get it
Orion's hound shines bright
Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running, running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided
By the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach
Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra, you might fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Sister mine
Find myself in darkest places
Find myself drifting away
(Death's a certain thing)
And the otherworld, the otherworld appears
Find myself, she dies in vain
Cannot be freed, I'm falling down
As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you, my dear
And then there was silence
Just a voice from the otherworld
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade
Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
May my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end
Iliad
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell, show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
The newborn child would carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death will be a blessing to us all
Good choice, bad choice?
Out of three you've choosen misery
Power and wisdom you deny
Bad choice, bad choice
War is the only answer
When love will conquer fear
So the judgment's been made
To the fairest, the graceful says
Badly he fails
(Warning)
Fear the heat of passion, father king
Don't let him in, don't let her in
Desire, lust, obssession, death they'll bring
We can't get out once they are in
She's like the sunrise
Outshines the moon at night
Precious like starlight
She'll bring in a murderous price
In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat
Jealousy
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now
The thread of life is spun
The coin's been placed below my tongue
Never give up, never give in
Be on our side so we can win
Never give up, never give in
Be on our side
Old moon's time is soon to come
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose, like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm created by man
Troy, Troy, Troy, Troy
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb
Hallowed Troy shall fall
Round the wall
Faith is shattered, bodies fall
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose, like one we'll stand
It's all for one and one for all
All we live for will be wiped out
I feel that something's wrong
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon, your time goes by
A new moon's still kept out of sight
(We live)
Misty tales and poems lost
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
May my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end
Iliad
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell, show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
Roam in darkness
Spread the vision
We will be lost if you truly believe
Troy in darkness
There's a cold emptiness in our hearts
That they've gone away
And won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite
The end is near
You'd better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
The war, it is over, forevermore
No hope, the blind leads the blind
Carry on, though future's denied
Mare or stallion, there's far more inside
We're in at the kill
We'll cheerfully die

I skid all over marks like I’m haunted
Rev it up, twirl my la la like profits

My path massive demands panoramic
Massive
Shitty, you’re ten thousand leagues subzero, sweat dripping

Standoff through low lands eerie silencing

Severe swerving I tow lag
Off uncertainty 'til your zipper locks

Sixty shots a second on a hexed clock
I strike ‘tween each time your solar plex drops

I can’t help yourself, I skid in doubt
I’ve dealt with yourself, I tricked hell out
I’m all helter skelter, I’m on that Faust
None of me left but reflex skidding out
Pulse in my chest feel like it’s fixing to bounce
Bounce, bitch, I can’t be the road
I’m crashing into planes, I crash and stroll
Maxed out my oath
Don’t blame me, I’ve no soul

Tall knives in my grill feel potent
My jigsaw manipulates you open
My skids writ rubbernecks agent orange
I skid like I’m no use
My headband expand like I choose juice
I binge, all black enhance my tragic
Ends to a means I can’t establish
Noise of nomads on sapphire spice
Cumulus in both hands, can’t kill myself twice
Pawns tremble like dildos wielded by duppies
Traumatized on for size, roadkill hides like yuppies
I’m too passcode, these gates won’t stay closed
Control gets old, I smash out my skin
My vessel thrown like slack at the wind
I’m finally astral now, grab my stems
