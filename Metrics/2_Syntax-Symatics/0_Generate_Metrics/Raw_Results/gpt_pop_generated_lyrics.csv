How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know still I miss you somehow?

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

""Baby,"" I said, ""Please stay
Give our love a chance for one more day""
We could've worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about
But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end

From the bottom of my broken heart (My broken heart)
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
(You were my real love) You were my real love

She reminds me so much of me
Starting out in a brand new world
Who she gonna be?
Will she follow everything that's been said?
Maybe listen to her heart instead
Maybe she needs to be free
She got that from me

What you get is what you see
It's a fantasy life, but it's real to me
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it
I didn't want to live in a box or mansion fault with doors and locks so I never let anyone put me through it

Telling me who I am, what to do with my body
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it

Faded, oh

It was overcast that day
And I was feeling some kind of way
I pulled the covers up over my head
Tried reaching for you, but that was then
I can’t forget

My heart's hung over but ain't nothing different
I close my eyes, nothing but faded pictures
Of you, of you...

Faded
Baby you’re faded
Baby you’re faded
Faded
You come and you go
You’re just an echo
A whisper in my ear, but in the morning you’re not here
So intangible, just like an echo

Still try and pretend this possible
To bring us back to life
But we continue to subside
Hanging on for life on this rollercoaster ride

I call your name baby, subconsciously
Always somewhere but you're not there for me
Boy you, boy you...

Faded
Baby you’re faded

Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith

Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it

Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""

It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again

Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay

And I thank you, ‘cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, ‘cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

Is there another chance
To bring her flowers
So she will only whisper my name
A chance to make things right for her
And make my lies seem true

Don't go down to the station
Somehow we won't live that long
Don't go now, desert flower
Cause you just won't bloom
And your memories made need more room
See that mirror there
Will she look inside
To see the one I fear standing alone
And on my phonograph
Will she put them in
The songs that only remind her of me

And make my life seem true

If they sink, I won't swim
Like I won't hold my breath when I float in this bitch
Backstroke, high-dive, diving boards don't slip

20,20,Pop,"We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you","we touch, i feel a rush we clutch, it isnt much but its enough to make you forget everything is alright i keep on helping you keep on coming i am not listening to your apologies i only hear what you want your fordays and at night i cant stop it then its over and i go again then its over and again...

21,21,Pop,"Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane

Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)

To cure their hearts of stone.

And would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second shot at romance? Aw baby
I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't 'til now I see...

How much I missed you
Girl, I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

Remember Mimi or Vita? Remember Iesha or Eva? (I ain't got 'em no more)
Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, was the same outcome as Chilli
(Girl, I let 'em all go)
Oooh, no more tricking and kissing miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you

How much I missed you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool

You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride

Flying over my head

You occupied my bed
In our darkness
We conjured up sunlight
In our haste, our need, our thirst
We lost our sight

I heard your name
When I trip from your lips
My heart was like a kick-drum
And it silenced the guilt
I wasn't raised to hurt anyone

With matches to start a fire

And your Madonna
You couldn't see anything
Behind your baby's mama

For you to come back
