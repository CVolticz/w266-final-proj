Visualizing the realism of life and actuality

Various women, I'm swimming in, like a shark
Tear the pussy apart, shawty it's on after dark
Step to the mic and now I got ya, call me Young Sinatra
The flow is prominent, hella dominant, on time with it
When I'm rhyming it, several labels itching to sign with it
Let's check the women I'm bringing in with these ill synonyms
Softly killing 'em, in other words; I'm Lauryn Hillin 'em
I swear to god if I could I'd never turn the page
Living the rest of my days on stage
Fucking with bitches that never age
I'm so fly that I defy the laws of physics
I ain't think it was possible for a check to have this many digits
Mathematically exquisite, am I cocky—just a smidget
If you want beef then we can supersize it
Freshman in the game
So they wanna haze me like my name Isaac
I killed the beat and dig a ditch just to fossilize it
To make sure none of you bammers try to reprise it what

Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some

I'm working a nine to five just to survive, barely staying alive
Hard to stay focused without the drive
See I bus tables and my homie Castro is a waiter
I can't wait to blow and say ""I told you so haters!""
Living the life of a egotistical pistol gripper
Isn't a life for me, I'd rather grip mics and undo girls zippers
But not them ho girls, meet me after the showgirls, but take it slow girls, have 'em coming back for mo' girls

Visualizing the realism of life and actuality

Various managers coming up talking 'bout they got me
But really they shadier than Slim in a pair of Versaces
I know you see me shining, and practicing and grinding
While they conform to the norm you'll catch me designing
A different type of sound
While you was stuck inside the box, I had already been around
Inner peace and happiness I'm always tryna' find it
And I kinda got the feeling that a woman is behind it
So I'm always chasing tails the real-life Sonic
And I'm always spitting fire half black, half demonic
Nah, I'm half black and half white
C'mon this sound it had to come from somewhere, right?
Nah, nah, see homie race is not the issue
And if you stepping to me like it is I'll dismiss you
The second you listen, the second I got you
I swear to god I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (""Hello?"")
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done
""Who said good folks is not supposed to die?""

The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
Him coming now, fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? ""Yeah, yeah, she chillin'""
We should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

4,4,Rap,"Tony dead and his brother too
Streets talkin' every week the coppers comin' through
And homicides scoopin' niggas out of Paulie crew
Damn, he in some shit just like a number two
So he need that lawyer money, plus that Sig Sauer money
On his second body so you don't want to war with money
Paulie got the word that somebody turned informant on him
Remember when he banged on Tony brother spin the corner on him
Maybe its them young niggas, talkin' to the police
Thinking about it every night, ain't been gettin' no sleep
He been spinnin' 'round that same corner for the whole week
Lookin' for them muthafuckers that was there with Tony brother when he let the clip roll on 'em
Going crazy thinkin' 'bout who told on him
Time tickin' doors 'bout to close on him
Them boys on the way to see the judge for a warrant
And they got his name on it, tryna put them chains on him
Cold as them streets is, he tryna remain on it
Even though the cops lurkin', got to keep them things on 'em
Layin' low at Kee crib, only one ain't changed on him
And she givin' info, told where to hit for
Put 'em deep with Tony lil' cousins and his kin folk
Paulie on some other shit, tryna get 'em sent for
Them young nigga bendin' backwards for him like its limbo
And they tryna kill somethin', cops tryna build somethin'
Paulie ain't tryna do no time take a deal, nothin'
Loadin' up his AK banana tryna peel somethin'
Tryna catch a rat nigga slippin' 'fore they spill somethin'
Somebody gon' die
And mommas gon' cry
Before Paulie doin' time
Cause Paulie gon' ride
Back in the field he got his 40 on him
Watchin' out for tinted windows when they pull up on him
He don't even trust the niggas 'round the corner from him
That he grew up with, he done got into it with
Investigatin' niggas if they tellin' or not
And then they feel some type of way he disrespectin' the block
But Paulie don't give a fuck, you disrespect him, you shot
Live by the chopper law and respect of the Glock
Hold up the phone ringin' said they rushin' the spot
The only time he play that crib is when he fuckin' a thot
He was fuckin' with Kee and she was fuckin' an op
But he ain't never think about it, she'll fuck with the cops
She told 'em everything nigga
I know you thought that she'll never sing would you?
Rule number one: keep them bitches from out your business
Rule number two: better kill 'em you know they snitchin'
It's all fun and games 'til them bitches turn to a witness
And know you in the courtroom waiting to get your sentence
Saw you out at Kee crib four in the morn'
Parked up seat low to the floor
She on the way he feel a way, this was one of his whores
And since he been on the run, he been fuckin' em more
Thinkin' about her if she come, open the door
Take a deep breath, I know what I'm doin'
Cause she gon' go to court and she gon' go to the morgue
And he gon' to jail and she gon' go to the mall
So he started walkin' while she parking
Wasn't even cautious
Parked up on her, had to drive her window out the darkness
He was supposed to shoot her, but he started talkin'
She screamin' out ""I'm pregnant,"" now he thinkin' ""Aw shit""
Started second guessin', that's when them cars spin
Paulie heart dropped he seen the Taurus
So he took off runnin' with the hammer, tried to toss it
Cops shootin' metal slugs rippin' through the car tint
Bullets hit his body while he runnin' and now he fallin'
Damn Paulie, bullet holes
Cuffs on let him bleed
Double murder, attempted murder, yes indeed
If he live, life sentence never leave
If he dies nobody cry for the bad guy
Fronted niggas workin' they the glad guys
Happy they ain't got to pay the tab guys
Paulie make it through to see the trap God
Drownin' in his blood on his back side
They say he gon' pull through and he gettin' charged too
Lawyer came to see him said he need like 80 large too
Got him in the County Tony people 'hind them walls too
And they say his little cousin crippin' bangin' hard too
And Paulie killed his favorite little cousin back on Part 2
And he can't wait to fall through
Friday they callin' yard too
And Paulie on crutches took the screw up out the handles scrape that bitch 'til it got sharp too
To be continued
I, know, you, want me to fall
But, I can't
Part 4 gon' be a movie nigga, literally","tony dead and his brother too streets talkin every week the coppers comin through and homicides they find the cops too snappy for no reason but alonous and funhottin them like sis people i did it been with a, probably 12 gang, two males on each gang and two females

And forever hollerin' ""Hootie Hoo!"" when we see cops

Shit, cops and robbers, niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
Anything goin', you ain't knowin' how much money you spent
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out
When you was broke though they was missin'
Now you ridin' 'bout fo' deep, startin' to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it
But legislation got this new policy: three strikes and you're ruined
Now where your crew at? Yeah

Ay, me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' 'em slabs
We better watch what we doing, and look out for Joe Nab
And quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block
Before our gangsta-ass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talkin' 'cause they making some flow
But still ain't did nothin' that ain't been done befo'
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish selling my last sack
I'ma take some of this money, go and give some back
'Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin'?
And start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave

I sold the dope out your house

You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much too hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time

Niggas know I ain't lying

Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south

Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners

Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure

In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby","brendas got a baby i hear brendas got a baby, but brendas barely got a brain,"" ""but we really gotta get the album in its time""

Shouts out to the homie D.O.C. (St. Clair)
Rest In Peace Eazy-E (St. Clair)
Mm-hmm, big ups Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and DJ Quik
It's going down y'all
We up in here, it's the cypher (Flesh-n-Bone)

See Flesh about to gash ya
No tellin' what me and my niggas 'bout to do to ya
We smash, leavin' you niggas without your nuts when we get through wit'cha
None of this shit is new to us, everybody keep doin' us
This is the era that my dogs created, they can't ruin us
Who be truer than us? I wonder what you might answer
These stupid hoes keep trying but don't come close
So they can't stand us
Stop tryna reprimand us
You niggas done lost yo' fuckin' mind, thinkin' you better
Just the thought of it is outlandish
I brandish an AK-47 then point it your way
""You dead"" they say
I'm handing out beatdowns every single motherfuckin' day!
Stay on this thug shit, there's no other way to make it bubble
I just might make shit pop but y'all don't want that kind of trouble
It's subtle whenever I slip into this mind state, y'all in danger
When I rip niggas apart, nothing left of them remain
So I'mma continue to let these niggas have it, and show no mercy
You fuckin' with ""one man army"" opponents never could hurt me
I'm playin' thuggin' when I'm on a mission, they say ""It ain't fair""
You niggas done had your warning
So why in the hell y'all have to take me there?
One thing you haters got fucked up about me, I ain't never scared
Come look me in my eyes and tell me if you see any fear
Still I'm that nigga from St. Clair, if you wanna question where I'm from
And where you from are them places that can't compare
You niggas ain't nothing but lessor, just walking dead as fuck
You're lucky to still be breathing my nigga but not for long, oh well
They finna get touched up heavily with this...
Touched up heavily with this rhythm, I'm givin' it to you raw
Hit 'em and niggas they feel it inside the dome as they broke off
Stack the 5th Dog, killing these hoes off softly, bitch now die slow
I send 'em to meet lil Deo, then they get sent to meet Diablo
Adios amigo, comprende? listen the way I say and slay
Nigga don't fuck around, see I'm serving these words I spray
Face it, nev'theless the fact ain't no escape, I chop your head
Pop it off your shoulder, then bury the head along with the hatchet
You niggas hardly expect it while you feel Flesh resurrection
Look at us sick and sore from stressing
Over the million dollar question: ""Something new, something new
When they gon' come with something new?""
But Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh gon' come with something new
You niggas ain't never heard it like some Flesh and the rest of my crew
Since my niggas the most bitten, here goes some more they can chew

High energy strong with the wisdom
Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
(Bizzy Bone!)

Its the classical doc masterful savage rappers immacable
Average I spit it casual package it
What time is it? Niggas clock me, I'm cuckoo
Lose every muthafucking scruple
Nigga this Bizzy Bone, Google me internet style, YouTube
Hand it to Captain Kirk, I'm finna Cobain the Kool-Aid
Fuck what these fools say, I'm in the county, no food for 2 days
2 braids, a plastic bag of toothpaste and bullshit
First class to the crib, that's how them muthafucking shows is
Lean with it, Wayne's world (I like that; Come on, ha...)
Lean with it, Wayne's world, Karma throw her theme with it
Seen with it, better be better than last year, king with it
She wanted Chris 19, and I put some dream in it
Now let me put that A in the middle, right where the seam splitted
Tell one of these niggas to pass the pump and let me take a toke
Red Hot Chili Pepper, my nigga that was a good joke
5 percent of thinkin' let me poof pow be gone
Rest in peace Chris Lighty; my nigga move on
'9-5 eternally, weed smoking most certainly
Black widow blew perfectly, talking Eazy through surgery
Supple with the serpent no slurping nobody fucks with me
Company on the move, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's back to loving me!?!
See these animals outta the jungle we never will struggle I pick up the
Ball and if one of us fumble I go to the gutter
And get all my hustle it's back to the booth
Nigga let's bubble lets get in a shuffle, let's get in a scuffle
I say that we rumble and rustle up niggas we doing a cypher
Dear Lord, let a nigga be humble
Y'all still don't understand, y'all rappin' fast
Stealin' my brand that's a whole new plan, man I'm just sayin'
You siphon nigga Iraqi style, duck a nigga like Pacquiao
Broke rappers get mad so fuck you niggas, with a cash smile
I'm asphalt, salient salts solvents and vaults
Crispy weed, jars full of joints, bars, niggas lost
Faded the 'Bron Cleveland play, Miami like Weezy stay
Get me the fuck up outta here
Cock the pump, slap the clip into the Glock and spit it fast so that I can get it, go with it
For the block, meet the coppers on the corner where they sell rocks
So fitted tight like a glove acquitted, I'm OJ Simpson
I'm Michael Jackson, I'm Lupe Fiasco
These muthafuckas don't understand me I'm flippin'
Threateningly leave the kitchen
Cooking these scriptures in liquids
Sautée that lettering in skillets of harmony
Spices, no cinnamon with one more element some rhythm and
Ritalin rippin' 'em, no vitamins, Biblical flowing like Gideon's
Clack back me pump, hollow point mixed wit dum-dum kickin'
Rappers that laying all over the floor, shut up and listen
It's a jack move, stalking gat fools, I got some bad news
We finna get at you
Kickin'...that's when we pass through
Tried to leave us out the cypher, let them thugs have a glass with you
Mash with you, five niggas rappin' with a passion, fast with you
Rocks that makes me flash with you, smash with you and at you too
Bone don't move 'til I ask you to
See my goons will smash half of this room if I ask them to
Before I leave, better ask my dudes:
Ain't we the coldest group ever?
Word to Eazy, nigga with attitudes
Cleveland city avenues
Crack house is the death of our mentalists
Momma lended a track and Wally my niggas
Shit grin, make me grin again, me and my niggas gettin' it in
Y'all finna be coasting to that same Bone shit again

Nervous for a second, then the rest...
(Krayzie Bone!)
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum

I come with a militant vision for all them niggas, that's ready for lyrical war
Finna do way more than just even the score
The thugs we come for blood, so guard your grill
We are the deal, we all real, y'all already know who that
They never seen a rapper like me that's relevant yet I'm considered a throwback
Call it classic swag it's Kray Action Jack
I pick up the mic and they all say ""damn, bad man do that""
The game done studied me long time now, but it still can't seem to really get it
Niggas wicked, just admit it
My niggas the sickest with it
I pick up the pen and I go in like a surgeon
Verbally come to save a dying game 'cause it's hurtin'
I tell 'em to follow the leader
We keeping 'em stumbling, they better speed up
Y'all niggas can't tell me how this game don't need us, we up!
And get ball, first and ten, needing a touchdown once again
The game is over, niggas, once I'm in
I'm sneakin' up on 'em like I was the wind and blow 'em away
And shoo 'em the way
The fuck up outta here, the storm is coming today
And it's in the form of Kray
I tell 'em you should've been checked the forecast
I'm so bad, with the pen and the notepad I get up in your ass
So how in the hell is they doing the cypher
But never invited the illest spitters, realest niggas
Known to kick a little ass and after that, handle some business (Hey)
I figure they scared of the Thugs just cause we too real
Still runnin' with gats and bats and hoes you finna get hit with true steel
We one in a mill, we coming to kill 'em all
Less drama more music, so don't choose it
'Cause I got a pump and if it jump off I'm gon' use it
It's mister goddamn murderer, lyrically kill 'em permanent
And after I battle wit'chu, y'all gon' wanna forfeit the tournament
Competitors no concern in here
Heartbeat but it never did pump no fear
So thinkin' you finna come up in this bitch and just lean on me, that ain't fair
Sick of these lil' niggas running around like Bone ain't they daddy
Illegitimate bastard, some of them resemble me a little
But none of them get it like pappy
And tell your mammy I ain't payin' her nothing, so don't even ask me
Real nigga, I still keep my heat and crease my khakis
I'm finna get ill nigga take out your weapon 'cause nigga the beat done got me
They doubt me, but ask yourself just where would you be without me?
Been here 20 years, many years they still ain't ready for me
I'm constant run like the river nigga, I'm steady flowing
They tell me they love me, the way that I flip it or spit the harmony with it
Created the lane and step on this gas, so nigga don't bother me with it
They know that title belong to Bone
So nigga just leave it alone, and let us move on
I'm here with that Leather, my brotha, my niggas are sick with it
Real as it get with it
We on the mission to pick up the pieces and stick with it
Flow like I'm liquid, so slick with it
Roll with them niggas that used to be criminals
Now we just get in 'em lyrical
Niggas been acting like me and my niggas ain't good wit 'em now that the game went digital
Shame them niggas don't really know that we started it, fathered it, birthed it
We be the heart of it
So give me the beat, the melody really don't matter 'cause I'm killing all of it
I hit em up in they mind like a 9  'cause its
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum redrum

Let the lil' man get a piece, fuck everybody
I slap niggas first anyway, nigga
(Layzie Bone!)

Who want it with Layzie, nigga, fuck you, pay me
Been doing is since the '80s, early '80s
Nobody can fade me, my partner in rhyme is still Krayzie
And we finna break bread
The rest of them niggas got laid down and play dead
With Bizzy and Wish and Flesh, I roll on them niggas
I never did play fair
We represent St. Clair
The struggle the grind, the grit and the muscle
The First of the Month, Foe tha Love of the Money
That Grammy the shit, that's how I hustle
Trust me, nope, them niggas don't want no trouble
Niggas be skeletons in my boneyard, trying to show hard
Nigga, I'll buck you, buck you
I cut like a Ginsu
Them niggas is going through what I done been through
I get in the cypher, I set niggas diapers on fire to show 'em what men do
They hut and attend to the order the generals call in the field
My 110 too, you're 50 percent and you claiming that real
Lay, that's why I'm hard to fade, Hall of Fame
Put me up in the Hall of Fame
Layzie Bone givin' you all the game
Y'all explain what's understood and never did have to be
Savagely I ravage beats, my money attracted magically
But I had the key, could've picked the lock, instead I chose to kick the door
Tragically it had to be for the ones that went form friend to foe
My thugs is indispensable, friendship is the principle
Boys to men to the end of the road, but Tha Crossroads not the pinnacle
It's a winner though, all original, it's history now I'mma make it stick
My nigga we 'bout to be Laker rich
That mystery murder man break a snitch
Taking trips, yep we party on plenty of acreage
The Bone be going for twenty years strong
Now how in the fuck can we fake this shit?
Bitch, yep I ride with 2 Glocks
Stick a rapper up for his new chain, hit 'em up like I'm 2Pac
Wanna do things? I move crowds cause that bang bang get too loud
Forever they callin' me young thug 'cause the unplugged is the new style now
Who in the fuck is claiming the best in the business
And where's the arena that niggas is playing in?
'Cause I'm 'bout to get wit 'em
I'm hearing king this, throne that
All the influenced Bone rap
Get ready my nigga we at it again, them other ones taking that long nap
Never met a click of five, mighty Mo Thug we still alive
FBG, yeah it's the life, Harmony Howse, and Seventh Sign
Perfect, nigga this A to Z and we workin'
Been around the globe with Steve Lo' shouts out to Full Surface
Nigga it's your time, Go time, I'mma bust in the low mine
Dangerous like a gold mine, clickin' up like Voltron
Biatch! (laugh)
(Wish Bone!)

Y'all niggas to quit that, this is real rap, y'all niggas need to sit back
Wanna learn a little somethin' from the teacher? I got that
Lyrical holder, spit fire, or smotherer, or get swolled up
I'm a grown man, with a life long plan, understand that?
It could go ugly, murders, how old do you think I am?
But I still got hands and I put 'em on ya
For the real rap era formula, I warned ya
Get missing, hood ceremony, got some ditches you bitches
At the same time, we move a life long hustle my niggas
Say sorry from the top, gotta lie, gotta have that money
Power, respect we earned that
Maintain twenty years in the game and Bone ain't done yet
You heard me, we ain't done yet
It ain't over 'til it's over, and it ain't over
Worst nightmare, don't you play with me
Or we can be partners, nigga, get money
Lamborghini dream, empty pocket realities, that's not for me, See me
We can part on the North Side, ride
And we gon' party on the East Side, ride
And we gon' party on the South Side, ride
We gonna keep it real in the West (West) for Eazy-E
Give me my shoes and I'mma run wit 'em
My story's far from the soft nigga, and I stand wit 'em
I got what you want and what you need
Only thing that makes me old school is this .38 snub
No clues, no fools, and plus my bad bitch she got  Ooh
It's amazing these niggas still playing, still praying
And all that's lost, especially the boss
And on that note, I'm lost
Y'all niggas go ahead and do this shit, I'm done
I love you Bri Bri

A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all

And the homie Heron rest in peace

He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein' jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't ""Pull My Ho Card""
.. I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin' niggas off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh I know (bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style
.. I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin'
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for ""1-8-7 on a cop""
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip!

It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (gon' get pimp slapped)

Money, I get it, paper I got it
I got the dope
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
Run up, ya get done up, I stay one up

If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worse than them devils
Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em
But I'ma say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up
Cause I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt (shshshsh)
See that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up (what's up)
He better keep it Crippin', and slip his clip in
Cause these niggas trippin', this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected misdirected, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Do Double in the hood again (Eastside)
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it (feel it)
So put the bacon in the skillet (hahaha), and try to peel it

Pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
I'm the animal that Hugh Heffner created
The only nigga Sade dated, the most hated, Nas nigga

Roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
C. O. Flip and jerk the whole yard rec
Block vets, pop barettas Glocks and tecs
You're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
Checkin shorty with the +Black Tail+ stance, leapord pants
Yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a New York state of mind, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws
Make my team click like high heels on wood floors","someday im gonna be walkin down the streets mindin my own business.. and bam!! im gon eat him up, thats why im gon take him to jail!<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",gpt2,0.0,0.0,0.0,"someday im gonna be walkin down the streets mindin my own business.. and bam!! im gon eat him up, thats why im gon take him to jail!"

With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs

Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal

I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

With every breath in my lungs

Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game
Some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed
And started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs
And started backing lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was planned in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real

Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man
Repeat Chorus

Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow yall find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood

Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines

And chances of y'all leavin? 'round now!

Hit the high school and 187 Caesar

Spit poison, got a gun permit draw

On my crew tombstone put, ""We all ain't shit!""

Yo, all you gonnabe, wannabe, when will you learn?
Wanna be Doc and Meth? Gotta wait your turn
I spit a .41 revolver on New Year's Eve
With the mic in my hand I mutilate MC's

Son I just slapped my bitch
Came to my crib 'bout half past six
Kid's in shitty diapers, no food was fixed
I was like, ""Yo bitch - why ain't no food fixed?""
She on the phone with her friend talkin bout dick
I snatched the receiver from that bitch like CLICK
She got all excited, tryin to throw fit
Swung at me then I swung back - BITCH!

What you in fo'? It happened in the club
With some thugs I was at the bar, smokin bud, hollerin at love
Ladybug was playin in my peachfuzz, she was
Talkin hot fudge, can't nobody do it like she does
In the hot tub - didn't know her man was in the club
And honey dove never mentioned that she had a scrub
It must have been the drugs or the alcohol buzz, had me
Shootin my game like a thirty-eight snub baby
Let's cut a rug, that's when I felt a shove
What the blood, dude actin like he won the Golden Gloves
I get one for holdin grudge, but if this kid throw a slug
I'mma throw a slug - that's how we be rollin cuz
I see this dud tryin to play me like a pair of Lugz
Big John Stud, Goldschlager in a golden mug
What you in fo'?
.. {*jail interlude*} ..

I'm locked down for tryin to hold my block down since a shorty
The Old Earth was like, ""Street put the Glock down""
I was raised in slums, love how the gun sounds
And now I got one - c'mon, who wanna front now?
Sunup to sundown, ready for showdown
Whoever wanna throw down, the gangsters better slow down
Wake up, before you be in a cell with forty of us
(What you in fo'?) In for murder over money love and lust
(What you in fo'?) In for life, don't let me tell you twice
I might bang you twice and take double the life
What you in fo'?

Jail status - get up
Wash a nigga mattress faggot, you heard about me right?
Pass off them packages cat, you gotta eat to live
Meet the crib; got a hundred starvin niggas in here big
So pop off, drugs that's props, bring in
Glocks we call 'em oxes
Be a real live nigga, swing mops and shit, take over shit
Fuck the C.O.'s, aiyyo Boo, I need clothes
Slide brokers where phones get hid
Fuck with Russians and Latins
The most powerful marble black slipper style
Goin out thrashin niggas, kicks get thrown
Big sizes, sleep in your boots, 4000 rugged F Troops
Notarized wigs, lay six months
That's alright dog, make it home Lord
Heard you admit it in the box, slid it under walls
Bang monster anger
Bop through the halls with bangers
Live God like the Abbot of all chambers..

Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown

I'm the youngest nigga repping everytime I'm stepping out
And if you step outside your face we pop up right in front of your house

Niggas think because we conscious we don't really get it popping
They forgot we from the bottom
They forgot we had to fight for every nickel, every dollar
Before the money and the power
You could ask my nigga Powers I've been putting in these hours
Plotting domination now the whole world is ours
Tell me why they hating, its cause of what I'm making
And if you a little patient its gon' be what I'm taking
They got me mistaken

I feel like Rocky when it come to paparazzi
Somebody stop me, fucking up my kamikaze

You know I'm coming for the top you see me getting bigger
How can you sign if you know you're tryna beat a nigga
When I made it to his office I was seventeen
Like forty floors up I grew a pair of wings
In that moment man I knew I could do anything
Feeling like a young Simba can't wait to be a king
And I never lost my hunger man I stayed hungry
If we started talking numbers man they wouldn't love me
Man I'd rather keep the peace but its getting ugly
But fuck it what I'm about to say is what they didn't want me
60k first week for the Bada$$
200k to this day I know you niggas mad
With the 80/20 split my nigga do the math
My nigga Kirk just outsold Troy Ave
Now they sleep we 'bout to hit 'em with the NYCK next
Got these niggas bread hurt, Limp Bizkit
Its crunch time had to go and get his shit wreck
Got the ninjas on deck and bitches in check
And that's a shot to anybody man I don't feel you

42,42,Rap,"Woo! Shady, Aftermath (B-G-O-V)
Look at that bitch, shit! Hey!
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole (yeah, yeah)
I think I'm losin' control (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby creek!)

I bought a girl Patron, I get in the Henn', I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm long so she hearin' me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone 'cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin' everything from white cran to deuce-deuce
With nothin' to gain but migraines and loose tooths
Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo

Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get'cha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party – turn the music up!
Let's get it started – go 'head and shake your butt!
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, everyday she be givin' it up

Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Aw, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

Obie Trice!

One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Wood just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious, full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the Coupe blew back with a blue new hat
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch?
True that, I had a few, Obie rollin' with brews
And Nathaniel annually knockin' the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit, then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang boo
It's Shady – you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum when the night came to the matinee
Mathers, Nate, Obie came to party
You better ask somebody

Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Aw, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

I done seen the gangsta niggas turn bitches
I'ma answer calls, I don’t like bitches
She'll still pull up on a nigga and kick it
I ain't gon' lie, we talked about this
I always knew that I would be rich
Shawty, she cry like I'm buyin' tears
She done kept it gangsta all these years
Used to write the bitch, she ain't write back
Now I'm on top, she don’t like that
I don’t think about it, had to let 'em know that
She can die tomorrow, I prolly wouldn’t notice
Try to hold me down, I gotta stay focused
Go and get the money, bust the safe open
Stay away from broads, I gotta stay low
Rest in peace my dawg, he got a halo (Yeah)

Free the bros down the road doin' real time

Ain't got no patience for bullshit

Lil' homie thuggin', he 13
Like a slim bitch, he just want him a body
No one went to the league, but we all ball
Make sure everyone eat, I don't ball hog
Swear it's somethin' 'bout the hood that make my heart beat
Do a show and fly right back to spark street
Been dead broke, that's what scarred me
Watchin' niggas hustle, that's what taught me
They was tryna leave me by the garbage
Now they callin', ""Meet me, I'm a target""
Do it for 'em, make 'em feel important
Knowin' damn well I should've ignored it
I buy what I want, I can afford it
Lot of money, I want more of it

Play with me, you gon' get chastised
Free the bros down the road doin' real time
All the homies, they call it the red line
He gon' only pull up when they say it's time

Faceshot with this AR, I'm bound to knock a nigga nose off
Drowsy off the Act', I'm sippin' lean until I doze off

Police at the bando, hit the back and cut the stove off

'Cause he ain't gonna make it to tell ya

I went to court the other day, the D.A. say she hate me
How you gonna hate me when me and Lou just took 20 racks
And put coats on them kids back
It's 30 degrees outside

24, how could I ask for more?
I got my deals, it's gettin' real, I'm makin' cash fo' sure
Stuntin' every chance I get, because I had it poor
But every time I go to sleep I hear the devil at my door
And I'm on them papers so them courts I'm goin' back and forth
Dealing with probation, man, they all said I'd be back for sure
Mommies turned to zombies from that raw
Because it's crack galore
You wonder why them babies runnin' crazy 'steady clappin' off
Gettin' life before they get pussy
Cause ain't nobody love'em so they lives get took'en
Locked in cages, have'em fighting over cookies
And lunch trays, just happy them days ain't never killed 'em
Yeah, I remember, it was a hot December
Niggas die on top of winter
Cause them kids need them toys
Well, Santa Claus don't see them boys
Or see the girls around here, there's Jack boys down stairs
No man with the big bag, just man with the big gat
Try and take your shit back cause he feel the world owe 'em
And his daughter want a Barbie bike for Christmas
He goin' show her, that the love is there, no mother there
Just her little brother there
We wash our pain with Belvedere
And use the drugs they brung us here
We get high to get by, hot dogs, no ribeyes
With tears drip from red eyes
When ends don't meet the dead lines
The D.A. said she hate me, but I don't understand
When I just rock the show in front of 50,000 fans
I think that bitch racist, she probably in the Klan
She take her pain out on me, but she probably need a man
I took my mom from public housin', put her in the sticks
We came a long way from welfare and gettin W.I.C
That shit just made me hungry
And now we gettin' rich, and all these niggas gettin' sick
I know they wanna get me hit cause I'm ballin'
Yeah, cause I'm ballin'

It's like sometimes I always gotta let these type of joints go man
Just speakin' to the streets
That bitch said she hate me
I felt some type of way about that
Last night we just came out
Giving 2, 3 hundred pair of shoes to the schools
To the girls and the boys basketball teams
How you hate me?
You hate me cause I'm doin' what I'm suppose to do'
And I got that money and I'm making more money than you
Well, bitch you can hate me for that

Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16
That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban

So many washed up with detergent

Empty out another magazine like blah

I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)

Moving, grooving, cause the music's booming
Macking, tryna get some action, packing, acting
Manish, drinking, tweaking, winking, peeping
Seeking a freak for the evening, really feeling way too horny
Reaking from the weed I'm token, choking, smoking, real doping, hoping
My nights wide open, knowing that my girl's at home
Snoring, boring, ignoring, warning that my girl was coming
Sudden mood interruption, busted my girl in the club

All I'm tryna do is get a number then I'm up out of here
Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend
Ita be just my luck this the spot they in
Not the place for her to spot me in
You know especially when I'm supposed to be at the studio
I take one step, what do I see my girl coming through the door but she don't see me
Now I'm ducking, now I'm dodging, hiding, praying to god that she don't come find me

You’ll never make me lose
So why you bragging on me?
Your ways was cruel, I was fooled
I was too blind for to see
My I.D. cover the news
Seems only trouble I keep
You was the one I would choose
Choose for to be there for me
Can't tell me not to do this because I do what I want
We came up out the street
Straight from the block selling raw
She said, she never will leave
Soon as she left it was hard
I wanted her here with me
She left me out with my boys
But I say, ""That’s okay""
Protect my heart with that rod
I’m running far out your reach
I mean as far as the stars

As I get raggamuffin, no bluffin, the body bagged
Breaks all your bad habits, bad blood fanatics
Clean up the magic, chrome startin up static
Greed means that you die quick, click the vision
Greed lies anmbition, five slugs for the mission
Seven cause you go to the heaven or hell and dwell
To meet your maker, but you met the shotgun shell
Buckshots sting like bees, I smoke trees
On the hilltops, clubshops and chilling overseas
Take in the breeze, Mr. Freeze squeeze the trigger
Killa G's got you week in the knees, to take it ea-sy!

Steel Magnolia
Magnificent guns bust when 'Uzi Weighs a Ton'
And yo' Glock spits, consecutive rounds shot from clips
Spells murder, sound synonymous to burner
Leave niggas ass up, gaspin for air, front seats of truck
So who the fuck want me to press on they luck, bastard they son
When gats start to hum and whole crowds begin to run
Annihilation, destroyin all expectations
Have relatives embrace your Harlem hopital, we all patient
5 foot 6, concealed steel, pop more grip
With fixed sights that drifted to right, triggers light
So relinquish son, I'm to the finish, and you acknowledge
Couldn't pop a clutch or light a skyrocket, nigga stop it!

Steel Magnolia, bury ya, six niggas carry ya
To your final rest area
What you worried though, you ain't above that with a slug
And your chest beats, blowin out your back, take it easy
To your eulogy, open heart surgery
Emergency, 911, come in a hurry
From the Hills to the Polo realms, stackin the bills
I put you under my lo-lo, hit my switch, then kill
A bitch nigga steppin on my toes, fuck foes and hoes
Get stuck in the ass like Pete Rose
I suppose you wanna get wild and throw blows, you chose
To get you nose your broke, in a thick cloud of smoke
You're like a fat joint, I'm takin a toke, I'm like coke

68,68,Rap,"Dr. Dre:
All you see is the sun, reflecting off of the gun
Ready for the showdown, to go down, at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
Polish the gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old 45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots to make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sounds of hooves
Sound like a thousand wolves
I cock back, with the toast in the holster and frooze
I pose as a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside and leave early
Just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
Eminem:
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name is Slim
You want revenge then don't shoot
I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you
Chorus:
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
Life ain't fun, when your on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
Life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
Dr. Dre:
He was shady, could see it by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
The shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
{Eminem: You need bullets, hurry up run}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
He pulled two at the same time and stood stunned
{Eminem: Go ahead shoot me, but I'm not the one you want}
I figured he was telling the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gonna do, it's on you
Eminem:
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group
{Dre: the Chronic}
Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it (Who)
Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two
Dr. Dre:
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rode two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Eminem:
Dre here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
{Dre: Let's shoot him in the kneecaps, he'll never see it coming}
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission, is to get him to stop laying eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
Dr. Dre:
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swinging doors in, and started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singing
It sounded like a G Thang, and a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringing
I said it's Dre's Day and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls an AK
Hollow tips started flying every which way
Eminem:
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gage
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled
Chorus:

Visions of home, the streets that I roam, it’s been awhile
Raise me like the father I never had, I’m still your child
And though I’ve grown in ways that you’ve never known
I’ve ventured into the world, I’ve moved out all on my own
I’m doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone
Seen shit you wouldn’t believe, I write em down in these poems
And put them out for the world, I know you listening too
Heard you saying shit about me I hope the shit isn’t true
Man look at the shit I came from, this narrow point of view
How you hatin’ on a nigga that wanted it more than you?
I ran through them spots with you and fucked the same bitches too
And just because I ride with you, I scrap with them niggas too
Came back for them niggas too, ain’t no trappin nigga, it’s true
Yet they play me on repeat because I rap for them niggas too
See I started with nothing but passion and then I blew
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view

This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song

Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin’ but to each his own
Gotta feed yo’ self, smoke a little weed just to ease yourself
Fuck the whole world, I don’t need your help
You’re the reason why momma had those rocks
All my niggas never even had no pops
Remember that? Ya remember that?
If ya don’t, double back
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street
But I’m still where the trouble at, where the trouble at?
That’s ‘cause my folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?

80,80,Rap,"With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', ""Nigga,"" this, and, ""Nigga,"" that
Call everybody, ""Nigga,"" and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, ""Nigga,"" then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear

With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, ""All Lives Matter,"" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, ""Nigga,"" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine

Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'

I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled

Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?

I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink they dip
Its hard to hang on, but I can't let go
Smokin' on my last breath
Blow out life whats left is death
Now I can go wrong or I can G or make a right
Whatever way that I turn, its still death after life
And if it don't discourage me, I ain't got nuthin' to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But I learn cuz I see, and I earn cuz I G
But, these problems probably havin' niggas prayin' to see

Don't do it dog, word up
I don't care if you black, white, Latin, Asian, whatever
We all go through pain
When you can't think, use your soul baby

Preliminary discussions is over with, the verdict is in
I took the rap throne back
I reigned like krills in '87, my name is on the map
It feels like a razor down the middle of my back
They slept on my lyrical ability to blow
Gave another nigga credit for inventing my flow
I'm a child of God, witness the rising son
From the cradle to the grave, I remain number one
This thing of ours, got competition taking red showers
Grieving mothers calling 1-800-Flowers
My repertoire burn your ashes in the urn
Is it God or money that really make the world turn?
Grab your gun, separate the ones from the real funds
Inhale deep and hold it in your lungs
The streets was requesting some original LL
A soundtrack for niggas that was raised in {hell}
They looking for a leader that can guide 'em through the maze
Smoke filled rooms, breathing in purple haze
Po' nigga's on the bricks his whole life
He ain't got nothin' to live for, so fucking living right
But if you stay in the rain like hurricane
Gold melts down but it don't fear flames
Toxic, lethal, psychologically evil
Genocide was committed on the black people
And the ghetto is a trap with glass walls
Should I sell drugs, be a rap thug, or play ball?
We end up in the grave anyway
The average cat and LL Cool J
It's a never-ending cycle, life and death
Until then may my mic stay blessed, to the death

I can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?
I can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind
I can't think, I want the paper, that's just the bottom line
I can't think, mo' murder every day around the way
I can't think, I'd rather get paid and parlay
I can't think, it's all about survival God
You know the epilogue by James Todd

Put your life on the line, you running out of time
The coroner's calling, she know she on a nigga mind
Amongst the dogs, real cats is hard to find
Even a nigga moms hate it when he start to shine
Get the money and run, dodge the devil and his sons
Spit powerful parables like a sermon has begun
Fuck the turntables up, leave the DJ awestruck
Attitude is what, keep the razor blade tucked
Too much flossing'll get your reputation touched
Too much rapping'll get your big mouth shut
Protect your neck nigga, you'll get it in the gut
You wearing a vest? What if you get your throat cut
Sold your soul for a dollar, now you having bad luck
Used to keep a bad bitch in the crib baggin' up
Player here, player there, nigga turned you out
But never told you beware
Never told you that black love supposed to be shared
And you never judge a woman by the texture of her hair
Fancy cars and gold teeth, G-strings and things
The almighty dollar replace the wedding ring
The Ark of the Covenant was held by a king
I ain't trading my soul in for skins and chrome rims

I can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?
I can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind

Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it!
The dawn, of a new millennium, came to pass
The world revolves around sex or cash
The black man's motto, ""Kiss my ass!""
Shorties in kindergarten are strapped, ready to blast
All I ever seen was killers and dope fiends
From FEDS Magazine to the heart of killer Queens
Bronx and Brooklyn and everything up in between
No matter what, you always got a Judas on your team
Giving it to the world and I'm telling it like it is
Tossing lyrical daggers and sending 'em in your wig
Know where the body's buried, I ain't saying where it is
Raised inside the ghetto, but dammit I wanna live
The legendary master of lyrical combat
But ain't no competition, ain't nobody to go at
So I'ma take the time and spit a universal verse
Hit the streets with a blessing and erase the curse

But he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend
He be playin' like a Willie 'cause he dress ya dove
Never knowin' that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin love, Duke is weak then he fallin asleep
You on the phone wit your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh

Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

Jew-els and Cristal got him actin' funny style
He ain't watchin' you, he rather watch his money pile
Can't protect treasures when it's in a glass house

Just because you blessed with cash
Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass

The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You got to try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love

Man made the money, money never made the man
You still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand
See, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown
Rock roller with so much ice your cap's polar
I got her smokin' beedies, modeling bikinis
Pushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me
I keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn
Teaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned
Don't get it twisted, getting money ain't wrong
But she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone

Leave me alone, work for y'all

Got a Tec-9, reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine

Puttin' them pants on shelves, waitin' patiently I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets

Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God, ""Man, why'd you have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's

Eating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto
Girl said that she need the follow, tweet her and she'll do any
Man, I'm trying to stay off, readin' 'em makes me angry
On the back on the tour bus, recording the two of us
Stacks at the Apple store, man this ballin' is new to us
Trying to make amends, bailing on all my friends
Niggas went to the club, sent a beat to Gucci instead
Man I'm feelin' right, my nigga Fam yellin', ""Don't stop""

And everybody saying, ""Get it while you hitting man
We want them harder beats, that 808 you slipping man""
Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter
Heard a voice in the back, hate from all the fake rappers
That I shitted on, shitted on
Shitted on, shitted on
Rap your soul, dude, let the mic blaze
Show 'em A-Town, East Side, all day
I put it on, I put it on

Life is somethin' IMAX, film is at a climax
I ain't even started, was it stupid I departed?
Man, probably, but now we do the things we always wanted
I'm proud of me, cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with

A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now every day we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs
This shit here must stop, like ""Freeze!""
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's
And that's a no-no

[Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls, before them blunts, got crunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Mama I want to sing
But mama I want to trick, and mama I'm sucking dick now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82, me and you like Tony Toni Tone

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""No not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat
Like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat
So we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

For a moment, a perfect world
We decided, we divided and now we can't return
I'll miss our world
We had a perfect world, for a moment
And I was, I was your girl

I can hardly even trust anybody
That's how it is and I ain't sorry
I was sittin' at the bar drinkin' Henny at the party
It was on in mind, I'm from the land of the heartless
Couldn't give it a second, I think I better go
When you beefin' for nothin' and need somebody to beef with
Somebody to grief with, it's good
Some people can't handle alone and some can
Some people can handle the lust and some should

She very independent but she know I know she need me
Please believe she really the only reason
A nigga still breathing but now you leaving
Feel like I'm losing my breath, My heart beating slow
We had everything but we let it go
But I just don't know why we did that
Now I'm sittin' in the dark all alone
And I'm tryna figure out how I can get back to ya

I miss our world
For a moment, a perfect world
We decided, we divided and now we can't return
I'll miss our world
We had a perfect world, for a moment
And I was, I was your girl
They decided we divided
Oh, we can't return
They decided we divided, they decided we divided
And now we can't return, now we can't return
I miss our world
For a moment, a perfect world
We decided, we divided and now we can't return
I'll miss our world
We had a perfect world, for a moment
And I was, I was your girl","a girl like you in a world like this a nigga gotta admit, she dont even know she could handle herself like this in real life and she wanna prove it with her own body""

dont you dare say you know your black skin and the girls, they dont even want to hear you say that shit!"
99,99,Rap,"No man separate what we create
Unstoppable, untouchable
Motherfuckin' worldwide mob figures
Death Row at it's finest!
M.O.B., thug for motherfuckin' life
Motherfuckin' made niggas
We comin' after these niggas, worldwide
Feel me! Makaveli the Don

My life in exchange for yours, born hated as a thug
House full of babies cryin' from a lack of gettin' love
Ain't nobody tell me shit, 'til I got a sack of drugs
Had the block sewn up, cause I learned to pack a gun
Do you feel me? World, do you hear me?
Catch a risin' star, fuck the love, niggas fear me
Got these niggas runnin' all wild from my double-R
When we ride, motherfuckers is sure to die
Boom once I enter the room, in the air
All you hear is the whispers of doom, niggas scared
They don't wanna see me head on
Think of all the busters that I had to leave dead and gone
Call a gravedigga, fuckin' with a made nigga
M.O.B, gunfire, gettin' sprayed quicker
Fuck 'em all, let 'em understand my plot to get richer
Much more than six figures, a motherfuckin' made nigga

(Can you feel me?)
A motherfuckin' made nigga
I got a plot to get richer
Take my picture, a made nigga

Nigga, I was raised on the streets, I had to hustle just to eat
My role model was killin' niggas, so I know I would never be weak
They got me sittin' wonderin', where my life begins
These niggas crossed my father, then my father crossed them
'Cause I roll with Immortal Thug niggas
And my number one plan to kill a man
To grab a needle and drug niggas
Niggas don't like us, because they bitches straight love us
The President told us to leave
'Cause the government don't want us
It's Napoleon, I get my pleasure out of sin
And seein' blood spill ain't shit 'cause I seen it at the beginnin'
A made nigga

How many niggas fall in your vision?
Gunnin' 'em down for every last minute that I spent in prison
We mash together, plus we get cash together
Blast whenever, knowin' it don't last forever
It's only one way out and one way in
Motherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot
Blow the roof off them groups like Rauf al-Mabhouh
I can't be touched, 'cause of the weapons I clutch
And the niggas that I'm under is just too much: we made niggas

Picture the scenery, 'cause for now you gon' have to imagine
Call me your prophet 'cause I predicted what's gon' happen
I began the paper, stackin' at those who be paper snatchin'
Will emerge like crack in the 80's
Fade me? Maybe, that's if I slip
But I became official since the start of this
Edi Amin, born July, 7th, a few shed eyes, precious
But others gave me they hate to cherish
But still I made it, a made nigga made by the game
Made for war, my aim is simple and plain
Yeah, whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain
You'll forever know my name, Edi, a made nigga

I ain't count the line, my strap, my head
There will be none of that
The young hog, K-Dog playin' Outlaw Immortal combat
With the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga
'Til he still and chill, recognize the real deal
Feel — a nigga made when I was young and dumb
With a gun, but it pays, so I'm bustin' for fun
And the outcome will be the same every time
We all gon' die, get yours 'cause I'ma get mine

Tha Outlawz, we be the Don Juan's of this rough shit
Rhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public
With my mentality of war
Dead bodies and silence, give it to you raw
Thug nigga to the core
The results of livin' poor, got me thinkin' on a made level
Shootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin' crazed devil
Mash shit from here to here, day by day, year to year
Made niggas on your motherfuckin' tear: I'm a made nigga

Call me a Bad Boy killer, murder motherfuckers daily
Know the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli
Gettin' lessons from niggas in penitentiaries
Game, when applied, help me survive several centuries
Lock me in a cage, I'll display my rage
Surround the court buildin' with the gauge and spray
They wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced
On my knees to God, beggin' for repentance
I'm so convinced that I'm a thug
They got me fiendin' for my cash
Like a fiend when he dreams of drugs
Diss Kidada and I'll kidnap your daughter
Kill your wife and hit the funeral
And tell you just who gave the order
Makaveli the Don 'til I'm gone
I maintain my army of lunatics that stay armed
'Til the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga
Outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga

Can you feel me? Come closer, ha ha ha
Get into the mind of a made nigga, I can't be touched
My adversaries get fucked, feel me?
Multimillionaire dreams
All I want is the C.R.E.A.M.
I sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream
Come and see, to see a made nigga
Outlawz, Makaveli The Don
Hussein Fatal, Edi Amin, Kastro
Napoleon, Kadafi, Mussolini, M.O.B.
I send this out to my niggas on the streets
The motherfuckin' made niggas
All my niggas on Death Row, Tha Dogg Pound
Tha Doggfather, and all his niggas
You know what time it is
Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Young Gotti
(Hahaha, Westside made niggas, beyotch!!!)

Uhh… Sarge… uhh…
We've got uhh 2Pac Shakur
Uhh Fatal, Fatal Hussein… uhh Kastro, Kadafi
We got a bunch of niggers here
They've got guns in their car
They've got weed, they've got money
They're with a lot of black women, what should we do, Sarge?
Uhh, I repeat, let 'em go
I repeat, let 'em go
They're made niggas… let 'em go
But, but Sarge, they've got guns, they've got weed
I said, let 'em go
Alright, you guys can go, I'm sorry
