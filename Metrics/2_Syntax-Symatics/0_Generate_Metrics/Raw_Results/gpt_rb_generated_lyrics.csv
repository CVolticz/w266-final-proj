We were over Gwen's
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe
Understanding my condition
I must surely be a wishing
And a hoping to be free
Some say, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Yeah, she said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly
Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
It wanted to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I didn't mind it
You see, I find it
A bit stimulating
But after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife
Hey, can you still boogie
Boogie down the road sometime
Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
You were trying to put me down
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
I used to sing this song, I'm dancin' on
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Mystery man, what's going down
That young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
How come you loved me, baby?
How come you loved me
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
You tried to have them shackle me
Bring me in
Tell me what for
So I'd satisfy you baby
You have won the battle
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
Her lawyers worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Trying to sell my home
Tried to take my life
Not my child too
Tryina upset my woman
Examinin' my soul
But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed
Asked the Lord to help
Wish he was in a position
To upset the judge
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you

That didn't help me baby

Every time I seem to disappear

A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, ""Hold it bud, I don't play that game""
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eye

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

She looked at me with that familiar desire
Eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, ""My name's Flo, and you're on the right track
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back
So if you want to have fun in this man's land
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands""


I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will


We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat and when Flo arose
She said, ""Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose""
I sat back down with a smiling face
While she went down to the powder place


The music stopped and the lights came on
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long
I left the place with tears in my eyes
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye","as i was walking down the street last night a pretty little girl came into sight and started acting like she was crying, so i called her mom and got her number and asked her what was going on and she told me she was having a hard time sleeping.""

When there's so much going on down the other side
It's like i live in a bubble with no trouble
And problems don't exist
I chuckle and tell them that ain't the case at all
It goes way back to the time when i was very small
Not in mind but size and age my papa use to say
You can always look at the negative
But you should always live in the positive
So i try everyday to live that way

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Some people live in what was and what they could have been
As opposed to living in a what is and how much they can
And be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way
The attitude is ""that i can't do nothing 'bout""
And very happy with just breathing in and out
The ones that when you say ""lets go make a difference""
They'll say ""naw that's ok""
So i don't waste time on the trip side
Because i do know the real on the flip-side
And i'm crystal clear everyday that's why i say, yeah


When i see the morning
And the sun is smiling down upon me
I joy in the blessing
That still the ground is not above me
And for the people
That i can truly say do love me, i feel
Positivity, because that's what life's meant to be
Positivity, because this day did not have to be

Some ask me why i'm such an optimist
When it's more fashionable be a pessimist
From what's in seventy-five percent of what we read, hear and view
Well i use to have a friend named minnie riperton
Who use to always say when she was living
""Like fine wine i like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty""
I'm not saying sometimes life can't be rough
But never to the point of me saying i've had enough
Long as my heart beats i ain't giving up
That's why i say everyday


When people ask me as an african american
What do i see for tomorrow in the human plan?
Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?
I say unity is only as big as our vision
And if its narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon
But true leaders must guide us through the ills of society
That stands in our way
So if the road is to harmony, be with the call
But if its about discord, don't take the ride at all
Because the world vision i see is the one-we for everybody

Warm to the touch, intellectually cold

(Do doop doopty doop)
And a recent friend
Of mine, he came up
(Do doop doopty doop)
And you know what he said
(Do doop doopty doop)
It's too late
(Do doop doopty doop)
Another friend of mine in a group
I'm talking bout Bobby boy, now
(Do doop doopty doop)
He said a young man
Sings his heart out
(Do doop doopty doop)
He walked up, he said, James
I had so much trials and tribulations
(Do doop doopty doop)
But I found out now
(Do doop doopty doop)
And you see, another friend
Of mine, he told me
He called me Bishop
(Do doop doopty doop)
He said, James
You was born to lose
(Do doop doopty doop)
I wouldn't take that for an answer
I went on down the street
(Do doop doopty doop)
I said to myself
I said, James Brown
(Do doop doopty doop)
Please, please, please, please
(Do doop doopty doop)
Come along, someone now
Aaaah, baby
(Do doop doopty doop)
Aaaah, baby
(Do doop doopty doop)
I'm gonna call a friend
Of mine in a band now
(Do doop doopty doop)
I want him to come up
And testify now
(Do doop doopty doop)
I want you to blow
(Do doop doopty doop)
I want you to blow for the people
Who need someone to love now
(Do doop doopty doop)
I want you to blow for the people
Who don't have no one to love
(Do doop doopty doop)
I want you to blow for somebody
That I lost long time ago
(Do doop doopty doop)
I want him to blow better than
On anybody's record now
(Do doop doopty doop)
I want you to blow for yourself one time
(Do doop doopty doop)
Aaaah, baby
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
Aaaah, baby
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
Aaaah, baby
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
I think I'm gonna scream
A little louder and maybe
You'll come on home now
Ow, oh, baby
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
Aaaah, baby
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
