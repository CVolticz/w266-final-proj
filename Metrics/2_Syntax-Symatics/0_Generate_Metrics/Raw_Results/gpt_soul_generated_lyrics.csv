When stars above came out to play
And now as I wonder
My thoughts ever stray
South of the border
Down Mexico way
She was the picture
In old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while
I kissed the smile
Upon her face
For it was siesta
And we were so gay
South of the border
Down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whisperd manana
For our tomorrow never came
South of the border
I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight
She kneeled to pray
The missionbells told me
That I musn't stay

There's one that goes and one that stays
But they will meet again, I know they will
You know they will
In the tinsel town of time

This boring life we have to share
You know that I care, honest, I swear
That's what I'm here but the facts are so unfair

They say that's pain up ahead and rivers of rain
There's nowhere to hide
And today, you must make a change
So to each his own
We'll go on our own separate ways

There could be some desperate days
And when you're on the ledge, don't stop and stare
Don't say a prayer
Just call me and I'll be there
You must be strong, life is hard
And I can't stay long
'Cause deep down inside, we know we tried
We had our fights
But you know the tale don't lie

Upon other lights, all the shows, sold out for nights
I'm back on the stage, I'm turning the page, oh oh

Say goodbye
Please promise that you will not cry
'Cause I want you to believe in you, show me you do

Like a chilling cold in the midst of spring
That last goodbye brings a flow of tears
Oh, it hurts to lose someone you held dear
Might as well kiss love goodbye, dry my eyes
She don’t love me no more
She don’t need me no more
I kissed her cheek, and sadly walked away
The words haunted me every step of the way
Wondering “Can I go on?” without her affections
As I slowly walk, there’s some strange direction
Wondering “What am I gonna do? Where can I go?”
She don’t love me no more
She don’t need me no more
Simply I ask, give our love another chance
But she said our love is in the past
The words kept ringing in my ear
I cannot believe that you told me, my dear
But she turned and slowly walked away, and I could hear her say
There’s no love left, now I’m all by myself

Along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me
Gone my lover’s dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me
Whisper to the wind
And say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a breaking
And making a moan
Murmur to the night
To hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing
And crying, all alone
Oh weeping willow tree
Weep, in sympathy
Bend your branches down
Along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall
Bend oh willow and weep for me","willow weep for me willow weep for me bend your branches green along the stream that runs from your land down to the sea and into the heavens.

Do not suppose your grandmum might cry, but there is something about this valley, this heart of yours, that stands in a sad place right now, it may be called sorrow.

99,99,Soul,"When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
Baby

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love
From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss
Sugar, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...alright

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love
Ladies and gentlemen
I have the pleasure to present on my album
Mr. Dizzy Gillespie...Blow!
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!
Do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your lo-o-ove
Oh, I don't care how long it might take
Cause I know the woman for me, you I'll make
And I will not deny myself the chance
Of being part of what feels like the right romance
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
Oh yea

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips

Do you want some chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you?
Girl, if you felt everything you heard me say
Turn your feelings in your heart back to me right away
And I'll get it

Do I do (do I do)
What you do (what you do)
When I do my love to you
Do I do (do I do)
What you do (what you do)
When I do my love...Nate!
I know the record is about to end
But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So if you don’t like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothing but a penny and you'll have a cough
I know I cannot rhyme cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I ha ha ha ha h-ha ha ha

Now everybody's talking about the jive is in...
Well I know I've got something for your body...
