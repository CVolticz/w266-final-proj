Deep down inside
I know I still love him
But he'll never know
Cause I'll never tell
I'll confide that I'm thinking of him
And wishing him well
I can't walk up to him and say to him
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hid
Lately I've seen
That look in his eyes
That just breaks my heart
He needs me so
To lean on at this moment
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hid
Maybe someday I'll throw off my foolish pride
This ain't so good
Watching him die this way
Cause he's the same guy inside
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hid",Human Written,1 Human,24,8,0,75,25

Melting on the eastern shore
Rain is falling down on me
Been waiting for eternity...
I'll be there!
Freedom for us all!
And I wonder why, why my heart still yearns
And I wonder why, why the earth still turns
And I wonder why, why the sky turns black
Still I wonder why, but there is no turning back
For all eternity, for all the world to see
We're riding high across the wind
And when the storm begins, to wash away all sins
We'll find a place where we'll begin
There's something wrong with the world today
Only the people that are fighting for...
...a better place in the world today
They don't believe that they gone too far
...they're falling down
By moonlight there's a way... for rebellion
Here, the world has gone astray... revolution
Now, the time has come to pray... hallelujah
Deep, inside our minds we wait... for rebellion
Here in dreamland we will not obey the masters
... and the earth still turns but I'm on my way
He is on the way, as my heart still yearns
... I'm on my way, now he is on the way
And I cry for more
Yes I'm on my way, now he is on the way
Gonna find the secret wall
I have seen the secret dreams
Of those who know eternity
And makes me feel like a shadow sneaking in
In my sleep I'm searching for a way to find
The open door leading me to where it all begins
There's nothing wrong with the world today...
By moonlight there's a way... for rebellion
Here, the world has gone astray... revolution
Now, the time has come to pray... hallelujah
Deep, inside our minds we wait... for rebellion
Here in dreamland we will not obey the masters

Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you about his years


Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale


Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go


Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale


Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again

Have been calling
But I wait to see her float down stairs
There she stands with her eyes full and yearning
I look
And I know gotta be there
Is there another chance
To bring her closer
Make her feel I know we could be happy again
Is there another chance
To bring her flowers
So she will only whisper my name
A chance to make things right for her
And make my lies seem true
I'm begging Do
Don't go down to the station
Somehow we won't live that long
Don't go now, desert flower
Cause you just won't bloom
And your memories made need more room
See that mirror there
Will she look inside
To see the one I fear standing alone
And on my phonograph
Will she put them in
The songs that only remind her of me
A chance to make things right for her
And make my life seem true
I'm begging Do
CHORUS
I step outside The Joint
To clouds of guilt and fear
And there are shades of red dancing in view
Las Vegas nights
Make me wonder
How much longer I will be a fool
A chance to make things right for her
Make my lies seem true
I'm begging Do

But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon

Those down days
When you felt so young
And everything seemed
You saw the people
Around you
Getting old
You wake up

Gone for you

It happens all the time

Nursing their fathers locked inside

Slumped by the courthouse
With windburned skin
That man could give a fuck
About the grin on your face
As you walk by, randy as a goat
He's sleepin' on papers
When he'd be warm in your coat

But there's somethin' in your eyes

On the street, on the stairs
Who's on your flight
Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin
But he's got her and she's got him
