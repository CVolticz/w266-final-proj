again\\n\\nFought in a battle, where nobody won\\nLeft ourselves a mountain to be overcome\\nYou cannot run away, past the said and done\\nI need us to carry on\\n\\nI wanna spend, time to live in\\nI wanna fall with you again\\nLike we did, when we first met\\nI wanna fall with you again\\n\\nYou tried everything, you never thought of before\\nWhen you live, in your love\\nAnd you give, in your love\\nAlways give up some more\\nNothing here means anything\\nNever did\\nI can live, I can breathe\\nI can die in my sleep\\nBecause you're always there in my dreams\\n \\nI wanna spend, time to live in\\nI wanna fall with you again\\nLike we did, when we first met\\nI wanna fall with you again\\n\\n(All of the time, here in my heart)       226       en\n","1                James Brown  Soul
